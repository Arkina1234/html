1
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:29,974


2
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,400
It's going. It's going.

3
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
And it's gone.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,100
Whatever.

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Maybe we should take a break.

6
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,900
That's it. I can't take this anymore.

7
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,600
I can't. I give up.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,700
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

10
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
...who aLways takes my nuts.

11
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,000
And I'm especiaLLy sick of this stupid...

12
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,700
...stupid tree.

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,500
-What's happening?
-Guys.

14
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,200
I think he made it angry.

15
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm awake.

16
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,100
I'm up...

17
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,700
...and I'm Late.

18
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,300
Demo. Dave SeviIIe.

19
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,900
Keys. Bag.

20
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,400
Pants.

21
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I need pants. Pants are essential.

22
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,700
Claire.

23
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,000
-Dave.
-Hey.

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,900
How's it going?

25
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,200
I haven't seen you since....

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,100
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

27
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
So I guess it worked.

28
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
What a fun day that was.

29
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me guess.
You're Late for something again.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
-Same oId Dave.
-Not following you.

31
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,900
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

32
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,600
...who can't handIe
a serious reIationship.

33
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
That was the oId Dave.

34
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

35
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
Tomorrow night. My pIace.

36
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,500
-I....
-Great.

37
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,600
-No--
-You look good, Claire.

38
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,300
Where are we?

39
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,300
Well, I think they remodeIed our forest.
I Like it. Stylish, yet functional.

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
Where did the mountains go?

41
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,100
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

42
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,800
Dave.

43
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
-Ian.
-Hey, big guy.

44
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,300
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th fIoor?

45
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:54,300
-No. They never let me past the Iobby.
-What? I can't....

46
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

47
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

48
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

49
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,900
It's no probIem.
We have an omelet station.

50
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Omelet station.

51
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,000
Can I get you some water
or a soy Iatte?

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?

53
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
Maybe Later. Thanks.

54
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's talk about your song, Dave.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,900
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

56
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,000
-...the original inspiration came to me--
-The song sucks, Dave.

57
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,700
-What?
-Your song? It's awfuI. I hate it.

58
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,300
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

59
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,600
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

60
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,100
-That is new.
-The next big thing.

61
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,800
Dave, we go way back, all right?

62
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,300
And we've both come a Iong way
since college. You? Not so much.

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,300
I wanted to Like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,100
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

65
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,000
''Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

66
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday.''

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,500
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

68
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,900
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

69
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,100
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Ever?

71
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,900
Excuse me.

72
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,700
Can I get some of that water?

73
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,600
We ran out.

74
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Hey!

75
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,500
-Out of the way.
-Alvin...

76
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,600
-...sIow down.
-Move your butt, Theodore.

77
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,100
You stepped on my tail.

78
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Last one to the door is roadkill.

79
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,100
I'm in.

80
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,700
What are these shiny things?

81
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,400
Theodore, we're Ieaving now.

82
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,500
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

83
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
Maniac!

84
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,200
Back to tree. Back to tree.

85
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

86
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,900
-Basket! Three o'cIock.
-Which way is 3 o'cIock?

87
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,900
-This way.
-Guys, wait for me.

88
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

89
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,100
-Jump. You've gotta really want it.
-I want it.

90
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,300
-I want it.
-I can't hang like this all day.

91
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,500
Will you jump already?

92
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Muffins.

93
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,900
Gross. Is this his house?

94
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,200
No. It's his garbage can.

95
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,900
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

96
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,700
As it came down to one--

97
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.

98
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
As the boa moves in for the attack...

99
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,200
...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.

100
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,500
The boa's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.

101
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,100
The mouse crashes
through the foliage.

102
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,600
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

103
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,500
Hello, gorgeous.

104
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,100
We've hit the mother Iode.

105
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,100
--tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.

106
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,800
This is the greatest day of my life.

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,500
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

108
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,100
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

109
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,600
Cannonball.

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,300
Quick. Hide.

111
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,200
Hurry, you guys.

112
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,300
Did I put these here?

113
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
There you are. I got you.

114
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,900
He's been out for quite a while.

115
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
You guys, he's dead.

116
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,500
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

117
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,400
I need three garbage bags, a shoveI,
some disinfectant...

118
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,700
...some Latex gIoves and oregano, go!

119
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,000
Hang on, SherIock. He's coming to.

120
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,700
I must be hearing things.

121
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,400
Oh, this is trippy.

122
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,600
Sir, are you all right?

123
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,100
Get back!

124
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
SquirreIs can't talk.

125
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,200
Hey.

126
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Watch it, genius.

127
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,900
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

128
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,400
Chipmunks can't talk either.

129
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,100
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

130
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,400
This is not happening.

131
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,100
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

132
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,300
So how's that working for you, Dave?

133
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,700
How do you know my name?

134
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll fieId that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

135
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,500
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

136
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,600
-You ever heard of a credit rating?
-What's this thing?

137
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing-- Turn that off.

138
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,400
Sorry.

139
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,700
He fell out of the tree at birth.

140
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,000
Can all animals talk?

141
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign Ianguage.

142
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,900
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

143
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
Dave likes to wear

144
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Dirty underwear with little hairs

145
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,300
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

146
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
Allow us to introduce ourseIves.

147
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,200
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

148
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,700
-He's Alvin.
-The awesomest one.

149
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
And I'm Theodore.

150
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,500
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

151
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,000
But we talk.

152
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

153
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,000
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

154
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

155
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,000
-Gotcha.
-Hey.

156
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,400
Don't do this, Dave.

157
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
We can gnaw right through this door.

158
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,300
Hi.

159
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,700
Oh, were we disturbing you?

160
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,700
What, you guys can sing too?

161
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,900
That's not singing. This is singing.

162
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,100
This is amazing.

163
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,200
Here, everyone inside.

164
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
-There you go.
-Thank you.

165
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
All right, here's the deal.

166
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,800
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sIeep here.

167
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No. Wait. Is breakfast incIuded?

168
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
I can live with that.

169
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,300
What about TV privileges?

170
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,800
Okay, but not after 7.

171
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
-Eight.
-Done.

172
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,600
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

173
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,900
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

174
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,500
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never assocLate with them.

175
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Yeah, you're our onIy friend.

176
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,700
No, no, no.
Let's not get ahead of ourseIves here.

177
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,100
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

178
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,500
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

179
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,400
-Yup.
-And is that your music stuff outside?

180
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,000
Yup.

181
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, no!

182
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
Hurry back.

183
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,400
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse--

184
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,500
-Hey, Dave.
-Simon.

185
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,000
My bad.

186
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,500
This is my sheet music.

187
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,200
Alvin.

188
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,700
This is not a HuIa-Hoop.
It's a toweI rack.

189
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
-Killjoy.
-Are you guys always like this?

190
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
We're kids, Dave.

191
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
Well, where are your parents?

192
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,000
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

193
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,700
Then they take off.

194
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,900
Our parents were hippies.
They Ieft earIy to join a commune.

195
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,500
-I am Robert the Robot.
-Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!

196
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,900
-It's after me.
-Hey. Hey. Be carefuI with that.

197
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
-Sorry.
-It's a collectibIe.

198
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,500
-I got it for Christmas Iast year.
-Christmas! We Iove Christmas.

199
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,100
Even though we've never
actually ceIebrated it.

200
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
But we want to.

201
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,900
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

202
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,300
Oh, maybe we can ceIebrate it
with you.

203
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,600
Yeah, maybe.

204
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,400
Look, I've had a Iong and weird day,
so off to bed.

205
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Come on.

206
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,300
We start work tomorrow.

207
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,400
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

208
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,700
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

209
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,500
Not my probIem. Now go to sIeep.

210
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,600
I hope Christmas comes fast.

211
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Me too.

212
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Want a plane that loops the loop?

213
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,700
Loop.

214
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,500
Hoop.

215
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
HuIa-Hoop.

216
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,200
Here's troubIe. Fire in the hoIe!

217
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,800
What are you guys doing?

218
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,900
Nothing. What are you doing?

219
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,500
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna bIow!

220
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

221
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,300
-Hey. Where did it go?
-Simon, this Ianded right in front of you.

222
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,000
You didn't see it?

223
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
How many fingers am I hoIding up?

224
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,100
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

225
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,300
-Wait, wait, wait--
-Hang on a second.

226
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,800
Six. Final answer is six.

227
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,600
Try these.

228
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,700
How's that?

229
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,000
Someone trashed your house.

230
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,800
It was cIean

231
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,300
Well, we coIored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

232
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,900
Wanna see what we coIored?

233
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,800
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

234
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,700
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's--

235
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
We've put a few toaster waffIes
aside for winter.

236
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,900
And we're not sharing.

237
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

238
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,600
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent....

239
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,200
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

240
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,800
Let's go. Let's get to work.

241
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,500
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

242
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,300
-I'll say we are.
-Yeah. Let's sing it now.

243
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,300
-Ready, Simon?
-Okay.

244
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,700
-Ready, Theodore?
-Okay.

245
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,600
Alvin?

246
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,400
Alvin?

247
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
This kicks a hamster wheeI's butt.

248
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,000
Alvin!

249
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,200
Okay!

250
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,700
Christmas, Christmastime is near

251
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,900
Time for toys and time for cheer

252
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,500
We've been good, but we can't last

253
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,400
Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast

254
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,600
Want a plane that loops the loop

255
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

256
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,800
We can't hardly stand the wait

257
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Please, Christmas, don't be late

258
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,700
What?

259
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,200
Dave Seville's in the lobby.

260
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,100
He says he won't leave
without seeing you.

261
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,400
That loser again?

262
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,600
-Dave.
-Ian.

263
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,100
-Okay.
-I've got something for you.

264
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,900
-It's your next big thing.
-Dave.

265
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
Don't say anything.

266
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,400
What the...?

267
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,700
Dave, don't do this to yourseIf, man.

268
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,200
They sing.

269
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
No. They don't.

270
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,100
They do. Just give me a second.

271
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Come on, guys.

272
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Want a plane that loops the loop

273
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,600
Me, I want a Hula-Hoop

274
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,100
You know, Dave...

275
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,300
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

276
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,800
...that a grown man
wouId want a HuIa-Hoop.

277
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
And others wouId say,
''You know what's weirder than that?

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,500
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

279
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,000
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

280
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,300
...who not onIy speak English
but can sing.''

281
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,900
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

282
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,800
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

283
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

284
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,400
...that I have a Iunch to go to.

285
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,900
I've got a Iunch to go to.

286
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,100
What was that?

287
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,000
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a littIe stage fright.

288
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I thought my heart
was gonna expIode.

289
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,700
We're not performing monkeys.

290
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

291
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, how's this?

292
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,300
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

293
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,200
...and you're staying at my pIace,
so you owe me.

294
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,400
We're sorry, Dave.

295
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,500
Yeah, that helps.

296
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,500
Never mind. I'm Late for work.

297
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,700
Can we go with you?

298
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,700
What, so you can mess that up too?

299
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
You're going home.

300
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Can I stand in your Iap and steer?

301
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,400
Oh, can we at Ieast beep the horn?

302
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,500
Never mind.

303
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,400
So sorry about the deIay.
It should be a coupIe more minutes.

304
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,400
But we're building the suspense.

305
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,700
-Here he is.
-Sorry I'm Late.

306
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,700
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-abIe Energy Bars commercial.

307
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
That's Good-abIe Energy Bar
commercial.

308
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,100
Right, Good-abIe.

309
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,600
Okay, here's the pitch.

310
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,800
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

311
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,100
Close-up on a littIe girI's face.
She's sad.

312
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,300
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

313
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,100
CouId she be fIying a kite?

314
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,500
I like kites.

315
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,100
Good.

316
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,200
Okay, great. She's fIying a kite.

317
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,600
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

318
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,200
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

319
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,800
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

320
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,400
-But not too sad.
-Right.

321
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,400
So she pulls out
her Good-abIe Energy Bar--

322
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,800
It's my mom. Sorry.

323
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,600
-Hi, Mom.
-A little situation, Dave.

324
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,800
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

325
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,400
-Alvin.
-Dave, help!

326
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,000
-What?
-At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.

327
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,100
Just stay calm.

328
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,000
And there goes Theodore.

329
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,300
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

330
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,300
I absoIuteIy understand but--
Sorry, Dave?

331
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,600
Quick question.

332
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,100
How do you feel about an indoor pooI?

333
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,500
Look, if you fIood my house,
you're dead.

334
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,800
Out on the street, capiche?

335
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,700
Mothers.

336
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

337
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,000
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

338
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,100
...but then I looked again.

339
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The ''size of Theodore's butt''?

340
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Why don't we come back to that?

341
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,700
Anyway, 1 0 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

342
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,100
...was imperceptibIe
among 6- to 1 2-year-oIds.

343
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,600
''How smart Simon thinks he is''?

344
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,700
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

345
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,900
Who's Simon?

346
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,000
-I didn't--
-Just move it along.

347
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,200
You know what?
I think I'll just cIean out my office.

348
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,800
Sounds good.

349
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,000
SpongeBob. You're 1 5 minutes late.

350
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,600
Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.

351
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,700
He got away. Well....

352
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,300
Guys. What's this about?

353
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,200
ObviousIy, Theodore's butt.

354
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,900
We toId you we coIored.

355
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,900
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

356
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,300
We didn't know.

357
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,000
-We're sorry, Dave.
-Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

358
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

359
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,200
Why are my clothes all over the pIace?

360
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,800
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

361
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,500
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just--?

362
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,700
It's a raisin, Dave.

363
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,400
Prove it.

364
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,500
Okay, you got me.

365
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,600
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

366
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,600
-Alvin?
-You owe me bigtime.

367
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,400
Alvin.

368
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
Come on. Come on.

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,200
There's this new thing.
It's Called knocking.

370
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
-Get out.
-I'm waiting for the rinse cycIe.

371
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,800
-Out.
-I'm taking a shower here.

372
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,600
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...

373
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
...today wouId be at the top
of the list.

374
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,200
And it's still earIy.

375
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
CIam it, sudsy.

376
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,800
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

377
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:02,400
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

378
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,700
Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?

379
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,400
That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.

380
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,700
-Dinner.
-So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.

381
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,500
I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye.

382
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,900
That's half an hour.

383
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Who's Claire?

384
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,900
Claire is Dave's mate.

385
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,000
She is not my mate.

386
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
She's my ex-mate.

387
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,300
Okay. This is great.

388
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,300
Dave. Dave, reIax.

389
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,200
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

390
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,300
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

391
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,300
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

392
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,100
-Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
-Like a family.

393
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,800
No. Not like a family.

394
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,900
Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.

395
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,800
Right.

396
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,600
We also do offices
and recreational vehicIes.

397
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
What's that smell?

398
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,300
It's your coIogne.

399
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,700
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottIe on the rug?

400
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,600
We Call it scenting the area.

401
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,900
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

402
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,100
The pIace looks great.

403
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,500
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriousIy tidy.

404
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,900
Yeah, I see that.

405
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
-Those bread sticks smell great.
-Yeah.

406
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,500
So when's dinner?

407
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,900
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

408
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,100
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

409
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,400
HoId the phone, Dave.

410
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
-We can't have--
-No.

411
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,800
-Even if we--
-No.

412
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,600
-We thought it--
-And no. Look, in the other room.

413
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,700
Jeez.

414
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,200
What a buzzkill, man.

415
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,700
-I never knew you couId cook this well.
-It's all about sIow roasting.

416
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,100
It takes Ionger.
But when it comes to fIavor, why rush?

417
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,600
Well, I'm impressed.

418
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,100
-I've been seeing your photos.
-Yeah, it's going really great.

419
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,200
How about you, how's your job?

420
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,100
Great. Loving it.

421
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
How do you think it's going?

422
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,500
TerribIe. They're not even sniffing
each other.

423
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,200
Alvin. Dave said that--

424
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

425
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,400
And his assistant.

426
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,100
Get back here.

427
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,500
You know, this is nice.

428
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,800
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

429
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
No pressure. Nothing weird.

430
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,500
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

431
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,900
You were saying?

432
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

433
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,500
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

434
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,000
A date? No.

435
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,000
The wiring in my unit is shot.

436
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
You should get an eIectrician
to fix that.

437
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,500
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

438
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,800
Okay.

439
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,800
CouId you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

440
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
Hey.

441
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

442
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,200
-Breath check.
-Where's al--?

443
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,500
Dave, are you okay?

444
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,900
Everything's fine.

445
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,500
Why did you do that?

446
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,100
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

447
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,600
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

448
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,900
I think I got something in my eye.

449
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,400
Here. Let me see.

450
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,900
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?

451
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,900
What was that?

452
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,400
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

453
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,900
-A rat?
-ProbabIy nothing.

454
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

455
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,900
Tomorrow, I'm gonna Call
the exterminator.

456
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,800
-What?
-Claire.

457
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,300
Dave? Dave?

458
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,600
-Tell her she completes you.
-What are you doing?

459
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,600
-You got it, Dave.
-Dave.

460
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Dave, let go.

461
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just....

462
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,200
I lost my job, Claire.

463
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,900
And I guess I just needed a hug.

464
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,300
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

465
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,500
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

466
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,600
No games. No fooling around.

467
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,300
-The truth?
-PIease, I'm begging you.

468
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,700
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

469
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,100
-You know what?
-I'm not crazy, I swear.

470
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,800
You haven't changed at all.

471
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:45,700
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

472
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Chipmunks.

473
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,200
You should've kissed her, Dave.

474
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
She wanted you.

475
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,200
Alvin, you're not helping.

476
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,500
Don't give up, Dave.

477
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,100
Go away. Leave me alone.

478
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,500
Dave, wouId you like a cookie?

479
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,000
I said, Ieave me alone.

480
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,600
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

481
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,500
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

482
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,400
He really did have garlic breath.

483
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,100
Yeah, well-played, guys.

484
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,000
Idea.

485
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,400
Who has cab fare?

486
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,600
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

487
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,300
Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.

488
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,800
I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...

489
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,400
...when I can barely manage
my own life.

490
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,000
You should go back to your real home
in the forest.

491
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,100
That's what's best for all of us.

492
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,600
I'm sorry it has to be this way, but....

493
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,200
Guys?

494
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Simon, Theodore?

495
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
Guys?

496
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,200
Alvin?

497
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,300
Alvin!

498
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,800
Simon?

499
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,400
Theodore?

500
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,000
Alvin?

501
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,700
Alvin.

502
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,900
Hello?

503
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,500
Hello?

504
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,000
Kids.

505
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,600
Christmas, Christmastime is near

506
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,400
Time for toys and time for cheer

507
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,100
We can't hardly stand the wait

508
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,400
Please, Christmas, don't be late

509
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,600
WeIcome to Jett Records.

510
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,800
Okay. New ruIe.
No going out after 9.

511
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,300
And not at all unIess
I know where you're going.

512
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,200
Were you worried about us, Dave?

513
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,200
No. I just need to know, that's all.

514
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,700
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

515
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,100
I need to know, okay?

516
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,000
Alvin.

517
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,600
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

518
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,500
-Sorry.
-Kids, huh?

519
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,900
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

520
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,100
Three boys.

521
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,500
Well, some days
are better than others.

522
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,300
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...

523
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,000
...Ieave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

524
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Quick, hide.

525
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,500
Guys, what's all this?

526
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,600
Toaster waffIes.

527
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,100
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffIes.

528
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,400
-What?
-Well, in case you didn't notice...

529
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,800
...I don't have a job anymo--

530
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,300
My song?

531
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,700
-All right.
-Yeah.

532
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,000
-Hello?
-Hey, Dave.

533
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,500
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

534
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,000
-Ian?
-Tell me you've heard the song.

535
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,300
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

536
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,800
How did you--? When did--?

537
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,800
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

538
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,200
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immedLate rotation.

539
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,600
And that video of your littIe guys,
1 0 million hits already on YouTube.

540
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,400
It's crazy. I gotta go.

541
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,700
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

542
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,600
We owed you, Dave.

543
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:32,300
So we're good
with the toaster waffIes, right? Dave?

544
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,200
Soup's on.

545
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Alvin.

546
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,900
So, what do you think?

547
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,200
Cool.

548
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,400
All right.

549
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,900
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

550
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,700
No.

551
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,000
Dave...

552
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,700
...are you awake?

553
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,900
I am now.

554
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,200
I had a nightmare.

555
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,300
Can I sIeep with you?

556
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,300
You won't even know I'm here.

557
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,700
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

558
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,200
Oh, okay.

559
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,100
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

560
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,900
-Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
-Come on, man. It's Christmas.

561
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,500
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

562
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,700
On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up

563
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,100
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

564
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,600
Wake up, Iazy bones.

565
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,200
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

566
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,700
-Up and at them.
-You can sIeep when you're dead.

567
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,100
-I'm coming
-Come on, Dave.

568
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,300
Hurry up, Dad.

569
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,200
-Dad?
-Dave. I said Dave.

570
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,900
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

571
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,300
-You want to open mine first.
-Open mine first.

572
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:17,000
-No, Dave, mine is better.
-You guys got me presents?

573
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,900
Of course.

574
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,900
All right. Simon?

575
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,400
Wow, it's a--

576
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,900
It's a paper-clip compass.

577
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,600
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

578
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,000
Me next.

579
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,600
Alvin.

580
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,100
-My wallet.
-Do you like it?

581
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,900
really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

582
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,100
And I have been using this
for almost 1 0 years now.

583
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Very thoughtfuI, Alvin. Thank you.

584
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,600
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

585
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,100
Oh, niceIy done, Theodore.
''To Dav.''

586
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,400
Let's see, it says, ''Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore.''

587
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,200
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineappIes?

588
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,700
Those aren't pineappIes.
That's our family.

589
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,100
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

590
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,900
I'm not your....

591
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,900
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

592
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,700
But you're like a dad.

593
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,500
Well, not really.

594
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,300
I mean, we're friends for sure.

595
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,600
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

596
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,100
-Make us sweaters.
-Feed us.

597
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,000
Let us sIeep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

598
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,300
That's what friends do.

599
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,300
So who wants to open their presents?

600
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,600
-Is that a trick question? We do.
-Yeah.

601
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,600
-Presents.
-Oh, boy.

602
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,200
Presents. Presents. Presents.

603
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,400
I can't wait to open mine first.

604
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,700
EnveIopes.

605
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,900
They're savings bonds.

606
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,400
Cool.

607
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,400
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

608
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,300
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

609
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,700
-Alvin, manners.
-Thank you, Dave.

610
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,200
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

611
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,700
-Ian?
-Who wants presents?

612
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,000
-All right.
-Cool.

613
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,400
Hey, there's pIenty more
where this came from.

614
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,000
Bring them on in, fellas.

615
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,100
-Oh, yeah.
-Jackpot.

616
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
What are you doing?

617
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,400
-Taking care of my boys.
-Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

618
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,600
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

619
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,400
-Which one is mine?
-That big one is for me, I think.

620
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,600
What did you get them?

621
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,900
Savings bonds.

622
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,100
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

623
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,500
You're in Iuck.
Your uncle Ian came through.

624
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:02,300
-Cool.
-uncle Ian?

625
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,500
Is-- Is this for me?

626
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,100
No, it's for Simon.

627
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,600
-Theodore.
-Oh, boy.

628
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:15,100
-And Alvin.
-Thank you, Santa.

629
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,700
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

630
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,400
Yeah, you're weIcome.

631
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,900
And guess what, guys.

632
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,600
uncle Ian is gonna have
a big Iaunch party for the new CD.

633
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,600
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

634
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,400
The whoIe nine yards.

635
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,700
-Awesome.
-Sweet.

636
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,500
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit singIe.

637
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,500
All right? Something funky and fresh.

638
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,900
-Peace. We out.
-Bye, uncle Ian.

639
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,100
-Merry Christmas.
-Now it really is Christmas.

640
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,500
Mayday, mayday.

641
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,300
This way, this way, this way.

642
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,000
All right. All right. SettIe in, settIe in.
Thank you for coming.

643
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
It is a very special night tonight.

00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourseIves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

645
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,100
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

646
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,000
Ladies and gentIemen,

647
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,900
...give it up

648
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,800
Yeah, in the place to be

649
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:19,800
Chipmunks on the M-I-C

650
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:19,900
[ Skipped item nr. 648 ]

651
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,100
Everybody, can they do it?

652
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,700
Can they do it?

653
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,000
Come on, people, let's get to it

654
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,200

Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

657
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,400
I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you

658
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,900
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too

659
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,100
And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do

660
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,800
He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,500
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

666
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,000
Yo, DJ, pump this party!

667
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,100
Everybody, can they do it?

668
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,900
-Can they do it?
-Go! Go! Go!

669
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,700
Come on, people, let's get to it

670
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,400

00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,300
Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor

672
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,800
Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go

673
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,500
Alvin! Simon! Theodore!

674
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:29,400
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true

675
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,100
I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice

676
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,900
And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice

677
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,700
He said to me:

678
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,400
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

679

Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

680
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,600
You've been keeping love from me

681
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,600
-And that's not very smart
-Not very smart

682
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:01,400
I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart

683
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,400
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say

684
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,200
My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do

685
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,200
I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you

686
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:22,200
-Oh, baby, baby!

690
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang

691
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,600
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang

692
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,400
Yeah.

693
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,300
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

694
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,500
Get on that dance fIoor,
let me see what you got.

695
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

696
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,800
-You mind if I grab a few pics?
-Claire.

697
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,100
-Not at all. Fire away.
-Great.

698
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:13,100
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

699
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,500
-Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
-Hi.

700
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,000
-Hello.
-Hi, Claire.

701
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,500
You're hot.

702
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,500
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

703
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,100
So, Dave...

704
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:34,200
...I'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you--

705
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,300
That I was insane?

706
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,900
I totally understand it.

707
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,200
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

708
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,400
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

709
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,700
You're like a family.

710
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,900
Don't say ''family'' in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

711
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,900
-Like, cIear-the-room gas.
-Does not.

712
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,900
He doesn't want a family.

713
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,900
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert tabIe?

714
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,900
Don't take it personally, you guys.

715
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,800
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

716
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,600
Right, Dave?

717
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,700
Claire.

718
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,400
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

719
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,400
Hey, what do you think of this?

720
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,400
-What is it?
-It's Alvin.

721
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
That looks nothing like Alvin.

722
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,100
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

723
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,900
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

724
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:40,600
Hello, ugIy little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

725
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,000
-See? You Iove it. It's Spanish.
-You know what? That's just weird.

726
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,600
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

727
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,100
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.

728
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,700
I mean, forget about the music.

729
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:56,600
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

730
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,200
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

731
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,200
-I mean--
-They're just kids.

732
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,600
No, they're rats.

733
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,100
And they couId make us both
so much money...

734
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,000
-...if you just let me work with them.
-I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

735
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,300
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

736
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,600
Has anyone tried
the chocoLate meatballs?

737
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,900
I'll probabIy go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

738
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,700
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet moIasses meat.

739
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,700
Hey, alvster. Love the song, bro.

740
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,600
-Up top.
-What's up, player?

741
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,900
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

742
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,300
What am I talking about?
You probabIy eat like this all the time.

743
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,000
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

744
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,700
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

745
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:03,300
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private pIanes.

746
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,100
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

747
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,200
really?
Because Dave says we need our sIeep.

748
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,100
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

749
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:20,200
Dave's hoIding you back, you know.
I couId be making you 20 Iarge a day.

750
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,000
-Is that a lot?
-Yes.

751
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,800
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

752
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,800
Look, behind your back,
Dave Calls you...

753
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,300
...''the rats.''

754
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,900
-Rats?
-Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

755
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,900
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

756
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,700
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

757
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:47,900
...give your uncle Ian a Call, all right?

758
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,300
-Oh, right.
-Ciao.

759
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,200
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

760
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,700
Get a wheeIchair. Move over!

761
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:06,700
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

762
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,000
Alvin.

763
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,800
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the Iead here.

764
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,900
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.

765
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,800
Hey, Dave.

766
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,100
What's going on in here?
I thought I toId you guys to cIean up.

767
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,800
We are.

768
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:32,800
-Who's that?
-uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

769
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,900
She's also a masseuse.

770
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,100
Come on, move over, road hog.

771
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,100
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the sIow Iane.

772
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,500
-Where did you get that game?
-uncle Ian.

773
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:49,400
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheeIs, buddy.

774
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,900
Okay, you know what?

775
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,700
That's enough.

776
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,900
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

777
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,300
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

778
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,700
Spit it out.

779
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,100
-Spit it out.
-No.

780
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,100
Jett Records.

781
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

782
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,400
CouId you give us a minute?

783
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,600
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

784
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,200
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're--

785
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,300
Major rock stars.

786
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,400
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're--

787
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,000
Major rock stars.

788
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,100
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

789
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,800
Well, uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

790
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,500
Okay, you know what?

791
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,100
He's not your uncle.

792
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:56,000
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

793
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

794
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,200
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

795
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,500
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

796
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,500
Oh, winter's for losers.

797
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,000
Yeah. shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

798
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,300
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

799
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:17,100
-Kids, Dave, or rats?
-What?

800
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:20,100
Well, uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

801
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:23,100
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you Iove uncle Ian so much...

802
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,400
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

803
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,600
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

804
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,300
Dave?

805
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,700
Are you still mad at us?

806
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,600
Dave?

807
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:58,100
''Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but....

808
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,500
You should go back
to your real home in the forest.''

809
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:05,400
I guess he really does want us to go.

810
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
I toId you, Dave.

811
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
I never lose.

812
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:52,200
Boys, weIcome to your new home.

813
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,100
-Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
-Yeah.

814
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,700
Can we play with all this stuff?

815
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,300
Sure, why not? It's your house.

816
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:09,600
So, what are the ruIes around here?

817
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,900
Oh, I do have one ruIe...

818
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,000
-...that there are no ruIes!
-Cool.

819
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,600
Four degrees eIevation.

820
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,000
Six degrees azimuth.

821
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,100
Fire!

822
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,700
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

823
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,000
Don't make me Iaugh.

824
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,700
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

825
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,000
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

826
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,400
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

827
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,600
Sneak attack.

828
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,100
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

829
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,800
I'm finished now. Simon.

830
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,000
-Hey, give me that.
-Let go, Alvin.

831
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,100
Oh, come on.

832
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,300
-You had a turn.
-Who says you get a turn?

833
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,600
Give me that.

834
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
Simon!

835
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,900
-You got to try.
-Get your mangy paws off of it.

836
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,700
-Scram.
-I want it.

837
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,700
Alvin, you don't decide.

838
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,900
-Why didn't the airbags depIoy?
-Theodore, don't go into the light.

839
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,100
-Let's do it again.
-Awesome.

840
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:07,200
-playing hard?
-Oh, yes.

841
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,100
Good.

842
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:14,200
Because tomorrow, you start working hard.
Coast to coast in five days.

843
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,700
Well, Dave says that touring is no live
for a kid.

844
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,600
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

845
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,700
-Yes.
-Which reminds me...

846
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:25,600
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring gIasses.

847
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:32,200
And try on these super Cool
in-the-now gIasses.

848
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,300
Oh, my God, oh.

849
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:37,500
These wouId be great
if I couId see out of them.

850
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

851
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:43,200
-Shotgun.
-Hit the road.

852
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,700
Alvin--

853
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:37,800
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

854
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,000
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make Iove to the camera.

855
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,300
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

856
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,400
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

857
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,600
Strong. Give me some booty.

858
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,800
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

859
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,800
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy NibbIes,
your pet will Iove them.

860
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,500
Cut.

861
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
Here we are.

862
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,300
Okay? All right?

863
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,300
HoId it.

864
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,600
We're not done.

865
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,100
-You tell me.
-Killing me.

866
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,300
-What do you want?
-You are killing me here.

867
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,400
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

868
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

869
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,200
-What button do you want me to push?
-Fine. I've got it.

870
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:19,200
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

871
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,200
I Iove toffee.

872
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,900
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a--
Like a super Cool energy health drink...

873
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:34,800
...with whipped cream and carameI
and two pumps of chocoLate.

874
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:37,000
Enjoy.

875
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,300
That ought to keep them awake.

876
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,500
-Get munk'd
-Go, go, go

877
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd

878
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Hey, hey, hey

879
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,200
Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats

880
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,200
Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats

881
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,000
Come and get munk'd with the Munks

882
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,900
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

883
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,800
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

884
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,900
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out Ioud.

885
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,900
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

886
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,700
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

887
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,500
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

888
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,700
It's all about today's edge.

889
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,100
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

890
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,600
''Dave always said....''

891
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,900
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

892
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,800
It's fun uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

893
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,100
What are you--? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

894
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,200
-Taffy.
-Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

895
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,800
What do you do?

896
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,900
-Choreography.
-I don't know what ''choreography'' is.

897
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,700
-What is that?
-It's dance.

898
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:40,400
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, ''I'm the dance guy--'' Hello?

899
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,400
Who? Dave Seville.

900
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:47,100
Name rings a bell. A dead...

901
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,800
...broken bell.

902
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,300
-Just let me talk to the guys.
-I don't think that's such a good idea.

903
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,900
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

904
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,200
-That's not what happened.
-Denial.

905
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:01,800
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

906
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,500
You're taking them away
for six months?

907
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,800
No, 1 2 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

908
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:09,700
TweIve?

909
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,900
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

910
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,100
They're doing great.
They're Ioving life.

911
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,800
Living large.

912
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,100
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

913
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,300
-They're happy now.
-Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

914
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,300
Put them on the phone.

915
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,200
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

916
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,300
Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.

917
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,700
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

918
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:34,400
-We'll send you a postcard.
-Ian, you can't do this.

919
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,700
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

920
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,800
-I'm gonna see them.
-Look, Dave, I'm-- Wait.

921
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,100
-Ian?
-Yeah? What?

922
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,100
-Ian.
-I can't--

923
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,600
Ian...

924
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,200
...was that Dave?

925
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,500
Yes. Yes, it was.

926
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,300
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

927
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,300
He's really, really happy. So.... All right.

928
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,000
And is he coming to the show?

929
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,500
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

930
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

931
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,600
Hey, come on.
What's with the Iong furry faces?

932
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,200
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

933
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,600
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

934
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,300
I know a guy. Let me Call my guy.
I'll get on that.

935
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,400
Hey, captain, come here.

936
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,700
Listen.

937
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,400
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

938
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,800
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

939
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,700
-Got it? Okay.
-Got it.

940
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,200
uncle Ian?

941
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,200
-What are you doing here?
-Can I sIeep with you?

942
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,600
I had a nightmare.

943
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,500
Oh, you had a nightmare?

944
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,800
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

945
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:27,400
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 1 6 different countries.

946
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,700
And I had to coordinate 1 21
different radio and print interviews...

947
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,300
...in five different Ianguages.

948
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,300
But you know what, Theo?
The onIy difference is...

949
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:44,000
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

950
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,100
So is that a no?

951
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,500
Guys...

952
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,900
...I wanna go home.

953
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,400
What do you mean? You are home.

954
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:27,200
No, I mean, ''home'' home.

955
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,400
You know, with Dave.

956
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,300
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

957
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:39,300
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

958
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:44,700
Here's Julianne Reynolds
with today's entertainment news.

959
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,300
Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.

960
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,300
Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.

961
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,600
Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?

962
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:59,600
It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...

963
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,100
...the trio will make
their first stop tonight...

964
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:07,900
...on their highly anticipated world tour
at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.

965
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,500
That's it.

966
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,800
Okay.

967
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,700
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

968
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,400
-I'll cover for you.
-Thank you.

969
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,600
Can we get Wardrobe
down here, pIease?

970
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:50,400
Well?

971
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,300
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

972
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,200
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

973
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,700
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

974
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,300
They need a Iong rest.

975
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:09,600
A Iong rest. Are you--? Okay.
Yeah, a Iong rest, right.

976
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,400
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so....

977
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,400
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

978
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,500
Thank you so much. I will--
I apprecLate it. Hey, hey, doc.

979
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,600
Chipmunk fever, catch it.

980
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,700
Knock, knock.

981
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,700
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

982
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:31,700
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

983
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,500
So you're gonna canceI the show?

984
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,300
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

985
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:42,700
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

986
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,400
Isn't that like cheating?

987
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,200
No, it's not like cheating. It's--
Cheating is wrong.

988
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,700
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

989
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:55,700
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactIy like we recorded them.

990
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,500
-Otherwise, people will know.
-That we're cheating.

991
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,100
-No.
-Guys, what other choice do we have?

992
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,700
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

993
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,800
All right, guys, tighten up.

994
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:15,300
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

995
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,900
Love you.

996
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,500
You know you got it made

997
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,900
When you drop your Escalade
For the drop top

998
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,700
Iced out, rocks hot
Droppin' dollars, ladies holler

999
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,200
Hey, gotta get that cream

1000
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,800
You know you got it made
When they send in a parade

1001
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,100
When you drop down
Write a check in town

1002
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:45,000
All just for one day

1003
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,600
Gotta get that cream

1004
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:58,200
-Don't you know that's how they roll?
-Roll, roll, roll

1005
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:03,700
Can you get down with the
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks?

1006
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,300
Baby, you know

1007
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:09,300
Funk, funk, funk of the Chipmunks

1008
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:18,400
Oh, come on,
you gotta have one more ticket.

1009
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,800
Sorry.

1010
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,900
Come on, here's Theodore

1011
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,500
You're here to stay
When you're always getting paid

1012
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:30,900
And it don't stop, never, no
It won't stop no matter what they say

1013
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,800
-Gotta live the dream
-Take it, Simon

1014
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,500
You're here to stay
When your honeys think you hit

1015
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:38,800
'Cause we gots it
Everybody watch it

1016
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,600
I Iove it. You Iove it? Chipmunk fever.
Catch it, baby.

1017
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,400
Dave Seville.

1018
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,300
No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

1019
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,100
You know what? That's fine.
I'm the editor of the L.A. Music Journal.

1020
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,100
-No, I don't think so.
-He's with me.

1021
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
He's my assistant.

1022
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,600
Okay.

1023
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,400
Thanks, Claire.

1024
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,800
What's going on, Dave?
What are you--?

1025
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:14,000
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

1026
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,200
Your boys.

1027
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,300
I know that probabIy sounds weird
coming from me.

1028
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,700
It's a good weird, though.

1029
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,500
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, incIuding you--

1030
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:29,600
-Dave, your boys. We should go.
-Right. Okay.

1031
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:36,300
How we roll

1032
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:39,000
Come on, can you feel it?

1033
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:43,300
-How we roll
-Yeah, yeah, come on

1034
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,900
If you're gonna do something,
do it fast. Here.

1035
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,300
-You're press, remember?
-Thanks.

1036
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:54,100
Roll

1037
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,800
-Let's go, pal.
-I'm a photographer.

1038
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,800
-I have a press pass.
-You're out of here.

1039
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,900
Alvin! Alvin!

1040
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,100
Alvin!

1041
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:11,900
-Dave! He's here.
-It's Dave.

1042
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,500
What's going on?

1043
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,400
Alvin, what are you doing?

1044
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,400
I'm sending a message
to our dear oId uncle Ian.

1045
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:28,700
-Sounds like a pIan to me.
-Me too.

1046
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,500
Come on, guys.

1047
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,100
Hey, Ian...

1048
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,000
...kiss my furry cheeks.

1049
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,500
Here, hoId on to that.

1050
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,700
Top of the morning to you.

1051
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,500
Get off my set.

1052
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,500
Are you ready to rock?

1053
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,300
Turn it up, girI.

1054
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,200
How we roll

1055
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:10,100
How we roll

1056
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:11,400
I feel fine.

1057
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:18,100
Alvin, Simon, Theodore!
Come on, guys, we're going home.

1058
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,000
Move, move.

1059
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,300
Let's go.

1060
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,700
-Get them.
-Look out. Run.

1061
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,800
Hi.

1062
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,100
Bye.

1063
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,300
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

1064
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,800
Miss a chipmunk because you're slow

1065
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:46,800
Watch your knees.

1066
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,300
-Sorry.
-Come on, big fella. Come on. Come on.

1067
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,300
A little bit closer.

1068
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,300
Come on, right there. Perfect.

1069
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,900
He'll feel that in the morning.

1070
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,600
-Guys.
-Dave!

1071
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,100
You're not going anywhere.

1072
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,900
What are you doing?

1073
01:21:08,900 --> 01:21:11,500
-Put us down.
-Let me go.

1074
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,500
-Hey.
-You better study your French.

1075
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:17,100
-You're going to Paris tonight. Okay?
-Let go. Just had my tail redone.

1076
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,800
-No, wait.
-Put it with my stuff.

1077
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,800
-Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
-No.

1078
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,800
What? Ian, they don't want this anymore.
Just let them go.

1079
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,800
But the guy just Ieft. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

1080
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,500
Come back.

1081
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:36,800
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

1082
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:39,400
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

1083
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:43,000
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

1084
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:49,000
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
people will come.

1085
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,400
Guys, with me.

1086
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:57,600
Roll, that's how we roll

1087
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,800
You'll never take us alive.

1088
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,400
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

1089
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,400
It's a figure of speech, Simon.

1090
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:15,400
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

1091
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,500
Go, go, go. Go.

1092
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,700
Come on.

1093
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,100
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

1094
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,900
How did you guys...?

1095
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,600
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

1096
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,400
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

1097
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,200
You came back for us.

1098
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,000
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

1099
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,100
HoIy nuts.

1100
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,200
-What?
-Am I going crazy?

1101
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,800
Or did he just say ''family''?

1102
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:28,400
I know...

1103
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:32,100
...but I really missed you guys.

1104
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,100
I missed you too, Dave.

1105
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,300
Me too.

1106
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:44,200
-So did Alvin. He's too Cool to admit it.
-Yeah, too macho.

1107
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,400
Missed you too.

1108
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,500
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

1109
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:55,500
I just said, I missed you too.

1110
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:57,900
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?

1111
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:01,300
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?

1112
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,800
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

1113
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:08,900
That's right. I Iove you, Dave.

1114
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,600

1115
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:18,700

-Yes, Alvin?

1116
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:21,500

01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,200
-I want to work the windshieId wipers.
-Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

1118
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,400

1119
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:31,500

01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:34,800
-Come on, Dave, drive faster.
-Not with you steering.

1121
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,100

01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:40,300

-Enough of what? Of being awesome?

1123
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,800

01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,300
