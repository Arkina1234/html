2
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,357
It's going. It's going.

3
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,736
And it's gone.

4
00:01:49,903 --> 00:01:51,112
Whatever.

5
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,616
Maybe we should take a break.

6
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,660
That's it. I can't take this any more.

7
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,370
I can't. I give up.

8
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,790
I'm sick of struggling for survival.

9
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,502
Competing with gophers and
earthworms and that loser sparrow...

10
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,545
...who always takes my nuts.

11
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,756
And I'm especially sick of this stupid...

12
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,675
...stupid tree.

13
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:16,304
- What's happening?
- Guys.

14
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,140
I think he made it angry.

15
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,163
I'm awake.

16
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,875
I'm up

17
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,710
...and I'm late.

18
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:36,217
Demo. Dave Seville.

19
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,898
Keys. Bag.

20
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,233
Pants.

21
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,360
I need pants. Pants are essential.

22
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,410
Claire.

23
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,787
- Dave.
- Hey.

24
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,831
How's it going?

25
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,959
I haven't seen you since...

26
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,837
Well, since you said you never wanted
to see me again.

27
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,172
So I guess it worked.

28
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:15,715
What a fun day that was.

29
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,760
Let me guess.
You're late for something again.

30
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,554
- Same old Dave.
- Not following you.

31
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:24,724
You know,
the guy who's always fooling around...

32
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:27,352
...who can't handle
a serious relationship.

33
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,561
That was the old Dave.

34
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:31,189
How about we get together,
talk about the new Dave?

35
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,232
Tomorrow night. My place.

36
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,276
- I...
- Great.

37
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,613
<i>_NO__</i>
- You look good, Claire.

38
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,123
Where are we?

39
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,253
Well, I think they remodeled our forest.
I like it. Stylish, yet functional.

40
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:37,296
Where did the mountains go?

41
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,092
Give me a break.
We're in a building, Theodore.

42
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,805
Dave.

43
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,976
- Ian.
- Hey, big guy.

44
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:53,104
Hey, you ever seen the view
from the 80th floor?

45
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,191
- No. They never let me past the lobby.
- What? I can't...

46
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,194
Hey, back off, man,
this is Dave Seville.

47
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:08,494
Mr. Seville, can I offer you
some muffins, scones, pastries?

48
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,496
No. I'd hate to be a bother.

49
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,749
It's no problem.
We have an omelet station.

50
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,333
Omelet station.

51
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,794
Can I get you some water
or a soy latte?

52
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,172
How about a shot
of wheatgrass juice?

53
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,591
Maybe later. Thanks.

54
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,790
Let's talk about your song, Dave.

55
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,708
Well, as crazy as it sounds...

56
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:58,961
...the original inspiration came to me--
- The song sucks, Dave.

57
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:03,674
- What?
- Your song? It's awful. I hate it.

58
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:10,098
You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it?
Justin, Fergie? Not a chance.

59
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,433
I need something new.
I need something fresh.

60
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,894
- That is new.
- The next big thing.

61
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:18,564
Dave, we go way back, all right?

62
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:22,318
And we've both come a long way
since college. You? Not so much.

63
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:28,199
I wanted to like that song,
but you heard it. Not that good.

64
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:30,910
If I wasn't your friend,
I'd say:

65
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:34,789
"Dave, you go right back
out of this office...

66
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,750
...and you keep writing music.
You'll get there someday."

67
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:40,253
But I am your friend,
so I'm going to tell you...

68
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,672
...that there is no sense
in writing songs...

69
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,052
...that no one is ever,
ever going to sing.

70
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,721
Ever?

71
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:04,861
Excuse me.

72
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,489
Can I get some of that water?

73
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,575
We ran out.

74
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,397
Hey!

75
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,281
- Out of the way.
- Alvin...

76
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,408
...slow down.
- Move your butt, Theodore.

77
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,077
You stepped on my tail.

78
00:08:58,331 --> 00:09:00,249
Last one to the door is roadkill.

79
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,834
I'm in

80
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:03,461
What are these shiny things?

81
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:06,380
Theodore, we're leaving now.

82
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,306
Okay, this wasn't my best idea.
Look out!

83
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:16,891
Maniac!

84
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,020
Back to tree. Back to tree.

85
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:23,022
Back to the dog. Back to the dog!

86
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:25,650
- Basket! Three o'clock.
- Which way is 3 o'clock?

87
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:28,694
- This way.
- Guys, wait for me.

88
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,239
Wait up.
I still have baby fat, you know.

89
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,908
- Jump. You've gotta really want it.
- I want it.

90
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,244
- I want it.
- I can't hang like this all day.

91
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,455
Will you jump already?

92
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:42,208
Muffins.

93
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:09,694
Gross. Is this his house?

94
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,155
No. It's his garbage can.

95
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:58,826
This must be where he stores
his food for winter.

96
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:01,537
<i>As it came down to</i> one--

97
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,457
<i>Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch
with no way out.</i>

98
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,917
<i>As the boa moves in for the attack...</i>

99
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:10,171
<i>...the mouse
seems to be facing certain death.</i>

100
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:18,304
<i>The boa 's sensitive tongue
tastes the victim's presence.</i>

101
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,890
<i>The mouse crashes
through the foliage.</i>

102
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,601
Come on, baby. Come to papa!

103
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,479
Hello, gorgeous.

104
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,857
We've hit the mother lode.

105
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:33,110
<i>--Tropical rainforest
where food is bountiful.</i>

106
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:39,575
This is the greatest day of my life.

107
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,495
Eureka! I found the cheese balls.

108
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,956
Alvin, what are you doing?
Don't make a mess.

109
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,584
Cannonball.

110
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,047
Quick. Hide.

111
00:11:53,214 --> 00:11:55,174
Hurry, you GUYS

112
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,274
Did I put these here?

113
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,011
There you are. I got you.

114
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,899
He's been out for quite a while.

115
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,400
You guys, he's dead.

116
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:21,278
Don't panic. Wipe everything down.

117
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:24,198
I need three garbage bags, a shovel,
some disinfectant...

118
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:26,450
...some latex gloves and oregano, go!

119
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,827
Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.

120
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,705
I must be hearing things.

121
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,169
Oh, this is trippy.

122
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,547
Sir, are you all right?

123
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,842
Get back!

124
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,344
Squirrels can't talk.

125
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:47,179
H9)'-

126
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,014
Watch it, genius.

127
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,725
We are chipmunks. Chipmunks.

128
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,228
Chipmunks can't talk either.

129
00:14:54,395 --> 00:14:56,105
Our lips are moving
and words are coming out.

130
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:58,190
This is not happening.

131
00:14:58,357 --> 00:15:01,902
I am not talking to chipmunks.
I am not talking to chipmunks.

132
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,280
So how's that working for you, Dave?

133
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,532
How do you know my name?

134
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,827
I'll field that one.
We read your mail. By accident.

135
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,329
You really ought to pay
that utility bill, Dave.

136
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,374
- You ever heard of a credit rating?
- What's this thing?

137
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:18,419
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Stop doing-- Turn that off.

138
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,212
Sorry.

139
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,506
He fell out of the tree at birth.

140
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,800
Can all animals talk?

141
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,345
Well, I believe fish
have this type of sign language.

142
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,682
Hey, Dave, do all humans have houses
that smell like sweat socks?

143
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,350
<i>Dave likes to wear</i>

144
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>Dirty underwear with little hairs</i>

145
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:38,230
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

146
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,483
Allow us to introduce ourselves.

147
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,986
Hello, I'm Simon, the smart one.

148
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,488
- He's Alvin.
- The awesomest one.

149
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,490
And I'm Theodore.

150
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,285
Oh, nice to meet you.
Now get out of my house.

151
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,996
But we talk.

152
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,291
Which makes me want you
out of my house that much more.

153
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,794
It's creepy. Unnatural. Somewhat evil.

154
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,422
I kind of liked him better
when he was unconscious.

155
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:06,008
- Gotcha.
- Hey.

156
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,142
Don't do this, Dave.

157
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,978
We can gnaw right through this door.

158
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,236
Hi.

159
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,656
Oh, were we disturbing you?

160
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,534
What, you guys can sing too?

161
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:16,912
That's not singing. This is singing.

162
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:46,066
This is amazing.

163
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,194
Here, everyone inside.

164
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,452
- There you go.
- Thank you.

165
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,998
All right, here's the deal.

166
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,752
You guys sing my songs,
you get to sleep here.

167
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,924
No. Wait. ls breakfast included?

168
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,011
I can live with that.

169
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,263
What about TV privileges?

170
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,599
Okay, but not after 7.

171
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:19,808
- Eight.
- Done.

172
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:23,395
But don't tell your animal friends,
because I don't wanna come home...

173
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:25,689
...and find rabbits
and skunks on my couch.

174
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:28,317
Filthy creatures, Dave.
Never associate with them.

175
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:30,277
Yeah, you're our only friend.

176
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,489
No,no,no.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.

177
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:37,117
Let's just start with me
being your songwriter.

178
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:41,246
Let me ask you.
Have you ever written a song before?

179
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:45,167
- Yup.
- And is that your music stuff outside?

180
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,919
Yup.

181
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:49,797
Oh, no!

182
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,131
Hurry back.

183
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:21,328
So, fellas, all we gotta do
is find the right song, rehearse--

184
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,500
- Hey, Dave.
- Simon.

185
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:28,752
My bad.

186
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,505
This is my sheet music.

187
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,133
Alvin.

188
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,680
This is not a Hula-Hoop.
It's a towel rack.

189
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,059
- Killjoy.
- Are you guys always like this?

190
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,853
We're kids, Dave.

191
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,479
Well, where are your parents?

192
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,816
When you're a chipmunk, your parents
take care of you for a week.

193
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,526
Then they take off.

194
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,696
Our parents were hippies.
They left early to join a commune.

195
00:19:55,863 --> 00:20:00,325
<i>- I am Robert the Robot.
- Help! Crazy robot. Help! It's after me!</i>

196
00:20:00,492 --> 00:20:02,911
- It's after me.
- Hey. Hey. Be careful with that.

197
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,748
- Sorry.
- It's a collectible.

198
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,461
- I got it for Christmas last year.
- Christmas! We love Christmas.

199
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,882
Even though we've never
actually celebrated it.

200
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:16,925
But we want to.

201
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,678
Yeah, you can never go wrong
with Christmas.

202
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:22,264
Oh, maybe we can celebrate it
with you.

203
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,349
Yeah, maybe.

204
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:29,229
Look, I've had a long and weird day,
so off to bed.

205
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,981
Come on.

206
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,150
We start work tomorrow.

207
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:36,194
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed by 8.

208
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,697
My tail isn't bushy till 9.

209
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,491
Not my problem. Now go to sleep.

210
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,582
I hope Christmas comes fast.

211
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,376
Me too.

212
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:34,920
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop?</i>

213
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,631
Loop.

214
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,508
Hoop.

215
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,927
Hula-Hoop.

216
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,947
Here's trouble. Fire in the hole!

217
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,615
What are you guys doing?

218
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,701
Nothing. What are you doing?

219
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,495
Stand back, Dave. She's gonna blow!

220
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:56,835
I got it. I got it, guys. Come to papa.

221
00:22:57,002 --> 00:23:02,090
- Hey. Where did it go?
- Simon, this landed right in front of you.

222
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,967
You didn't see it?

223
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:06,344
How many fingers am I holding up?

224
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:10,057
Four. No, no, no.
Eight? Counting your thumb?

225
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:13,101
- Wait, wait, wait--
- Hang on a second.

226
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:14,728
Six. Final answer is six.

227
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,568
Try these.

228
00:23:21,943 --> 00:23:23,695
How's that?

229
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,947
Someone trashed your house.

230
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,617
It was clean
when I went to bed last night.

231
00:23:28,784 --> 00:23:33,080
Well, we colored for a while,
but then we got hungry.

232
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,664
Wanna see what we colored?

233
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:36,583
Actually, I wanna play you
something.

234
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,628
I wrote a song
for you guys to sing, so let's--

235
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,097
We've put a few toaster waffles
aside for winter.

236
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,848
And we're not sharing.

237
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,479
Guys, we're gonna have food all winter,
so if you start storing it...

238
00:23:57,646 --> 00:24:00,607
...it's gonna get gross
and we're gonna have rodent...

239
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:08,198
Bad, you know,
non-talking rodents around here.

240
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,743
Let's go. Let's get to work.

241
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:23,296
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

242
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,049
- I'll say we are.
- Yeah. Let's sing it now.

243
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,051
- Ready, Simon?
- Okay.

244
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:30,512
- Ready, Theodore?
- Okay.

245
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,556
Alvin?

246
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,182
Alvin?

247
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:36,017
This kicks a hamster wheel's butt.

248
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:38,019
Alvin!

249
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:40,981
Okay!

250
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:45,485
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

251
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:50,657
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

252
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:55,328
<i>We've been good, but we can't last</i>

253
00:24:55,495 --> 00:25:00,167
<i>Hurry, Christmas, hurry fast</i>

254
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:05,422

00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,801
<i>Me, I want</i> a <i>Hula-Hoop</i>

256
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:14,598
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

257
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:18,727
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

258
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,482
What?

259
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,026
<i>Dave Seville 's in the lobby.</i>

260
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,029
<i>He says he won't leave
without seeing you.</i>

261
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:33,408
That loser again?

262
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,627
- Dave.
- Ian.

263
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:46,880
- Okay.
- I've got something for you.

264
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,715
- It's your next big thing.
- Dave.

265
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,675
Don't say anything.

266
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,388
What the...?

267
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,476
Dave, don't do this to yourself, man.

268
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:01,144
They $in9-

269
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:08,151
No. They don't.

270
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,904
They do. Just give me a second.

271
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,073
Come on, guys.

272
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,744
<i>Want a plane that loops the loop</i>

273
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:22,540
<i>Me, I want</i> a <i>Hula-Hoop</i>

274
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:24,918
You know, Dave...

275
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,254
...some people might say
it's kind of weird...

276
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,589
...that a grown man
would want a Hula-Hoop.

277
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,801
And others would say,
"You know what's weirder than that?

278
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,303
A grown man bringing
another grown man...

279
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,764
...a big box
with a bunch of chipmunks in it...

280
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,141
...who not only speak English
but can sing."

281
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,727
They do sing.
We've been practicing all morning.

282
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:46,731
Oh, you've been practicing.
I never realized. Okay, well.

283
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:56,408
Yeah. Okay, no.
Dave, I'm going to pretend...

284
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,202
...that I have a lunch to go to.

285
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,663
I've got a lunch to go to.

286
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,914
What was that?

287
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,834
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a little stage fright.

288
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,752
I thought my heart
was gonna explode.

289
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,504
We're not performing monkeys.

290
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,548
Why do we have to sing
for that guy?

291
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:12,799
Well, how's this?

292
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,135
Pretend I need the money
and I hate my job...

293
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,971
...and you're staying at my place,
so you owe me.

294
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,222
We're sorry, Dave.

295
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,433
Yeah, that helps.

296
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,270
Never mind. I'm late for work.

297
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:26,730
Can we go with you?

298
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,524
What, so you can mess that up too?

299
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,735
You're going home.

300
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,489
Can I stand in your lap and steer?

301
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:40,160
Oh, can we at least beep the horn?

302
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,411
Never mind.

303
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:47,375
So sorry about the delay.
It should be a couple more minutes.

304
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:50,378
But we're building the suspense.

305
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,632
- Here he is.
- Sorry I'm late.

306
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:05,477
Boy, am I jazzed about our
Yum-able Energy Bars commercial

307
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:08,646
That's Good-able Energy Bar
commercial.

308
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,857
Right, Good-able.

309
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,360
Okay, here's the pitch.

310
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,613
We open on a group of lethargic kids.

311
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,866
Close-up on a little girl's face.
She's sad.

312
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:23,078
Our customers don't like to think
of their kids as being sad.

313
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,913
Could she be flying a kite?

314
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,456
I like kites.

315
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,124
Good.

316
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,960
Okay, great. She's flying a kite.

317
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,506
She's running with a kite.
She's running out of steam.

318
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,967
She's tired and lets go of the kite.

319
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:41,596
Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad.

320
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,224
- But not too sad.
- Right.

321
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:48,520
So she pulls out
her Good-able Energy Bar--

322
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,734
It's my mom. Sorry.

323
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,363
<i>- Hi, Mom.
- A little situation, Dave.</i>

324
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,573
Theodore vacuumed up Alvin.

325
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,159
- Alvin.
- Dave, help!

326
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:06,746
<i>- What?
- At least it wasn't the garbage disposal.</i>

327
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,081
Just stay calm.

328
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:10,792
And there goes Theodore.

329
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,044
Look, I can't do this right now, okay?

330
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:16,047
I absolutely understand but--
Sorry, Dave?

331
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:17,590
Quick question.

332
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:21,928
How do you feel about an indoor pool?

333
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,264
Look, if you flood my house,
you're dead.

334
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,807
Out on the street, capiche?

335
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,644
Mothers.

336
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:36,484
Why don't we come over here
and look at the sales projections?

337
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:41,823
You know, when I first saw these
numbers, I thought there's just no way...

338
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,117
...but then I looked again.

339
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,791
The "size of Theodore's butt"?

340
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,752
Why don't we come back to that?

341
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:58,506
Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share
for healthy food snacks...

342
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:01,926
...was imperceptible
among 6- to 12-year-olds.

343
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,595
"How smart Simon thinks he is"?

344
00:30:05,263 --> 00:30:07,474
Yeah, as opposed to
how smart he actually is.

345
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,850
Who's Simon?

346
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,020
- I didn't--
- Just move it along.

347
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:23,406
You know what?
I think I'll just clean out my office.

348
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,575
Sounds good.

349
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,827
<i>SpongeBob. You're 15 minutes late</i>

350
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:33,416
<i>Sorry, Mr. Krabs,
I was out all night looking for Gary.</i>

351
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,502
<i>He got</i> away. <i>Well</i>

352
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:38,129
Guys. What's this about?

353
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:41,007
Obviously, Theodore's butt.

354
00:30:41,174 --> 00:30:42,675
We told you we colored.

355
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:46,846
On my presentation boards?
You got me fired.

356
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,307
We didn't know.

357
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,770
- We're sorry, Dave.
- Oh, you're sorry? That's fantastic.

358
00:30:53,937 --> 00:30:58,066
Sorry doesn't get my job back, now,
does it, Theodore?

359
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,027
Why are my clothes all over the place?

360
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:03,738
We used them to mop up the water.
Good idea, right?

361
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:06,491
Oh, my God. Theodore, did you just--?

362
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,661
It's a raisin, Dave.

363
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:11,371
Prove it.

364
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,252
Okay, you got me.

365
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,587
I wanna talk to all you guys.
Where's Alvin?

366
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:23,341
- Alvin?
- You owe me bigtime.

367
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,385
Alvin.

368
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,470
Come on. Come on.

369
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,023
There's this new thing.
It's called knocking.

370
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:42,026
- Get out.
- I'm waiting for the rinse cycle.

371
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:44,612
- Out.
- I'm taking a shower here.

372
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:47,365
You know,
if I made a list of my worst days ever...

373
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,784
...today would be at the top
of the list.

374
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,995
And it's still early.

375
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,204
Clam it, sudsy.

376
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:59,544
Okay. Guys, let me just put it
to you like this, okay?

377
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:05,341
I have no job, no career, my house
is always a mess. Thank you very much.

378
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:10,513
<i>Hi, Dave. It's Claire Wilson calling.
And why did I just say my last name?</i>

379
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:16,185
<i>That was weird. I guess I'm just a little
nervous about coming over for dinner.</i>

380
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,521
<i>- Dinner.
- So, yeah. I'm gonna hang up now.</i>

381
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,275
<i>I'll be there at 7. Okay. Bye</i>

382
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,860
That's half an hour.

383
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:28,031
Who's Claire?

384
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,658
Claire is Dave's mate.

385
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,827
She is not my mate.

386
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,704
She's my ex-mate.

387
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:39,125
Okay. This is great.

388
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:41,127
Dave. Dave, relax.

389
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:44,005
You just go get the food.
We'll take care of the rest.

390
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,090
Why am I having a hard time
believing you?

391
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:49,093
That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.

392
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,096
- Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
- Like a family.

393
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,641
No. Not like a family.

394
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,893
Tick-took, Dave. Better bust a move.

395
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,728
Right.

396
00:33:17,622 --> 00:33:20,541
We also do offices
and recreational vehicles.

397
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:23,252
What's that smell?

398
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,255
It's your cologne.

399
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,509
What did you do?
Dump the entire bottle on the rug'?

400
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:32,345
We call it scenting the area.

401
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,681
I gotta admit I'm surprised.

402
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:35,932
The place looks great.

403
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:39,310
Well, Dave, we chipmunks
are notoriously tidy.

404
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:40,895
Yeah, I see that.

405
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,981
- Those bread sticks smell great.
- Yeah.

406
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,317
So when's dinner?

407
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:49,737
Guys, I don't know
how to tell you this...

408
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:51,864
...but it's just gonna be Claire and me.

409
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,199
Hold the phone, Dave.

410
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,409
- We can't have--
- No.

411
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,618
- Even if we--
- No.

412
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:58,371
- We thought it--
- And no. Look, in the other room.

413
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,498
Jeez.

414
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:03,167
What a buzzkill, man.

415
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:08,715
- I never knew you could cook this well.
- It's all about slow roasting.

416
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:13,928
It takes longer.
But when it comes to flavor, why rush?

417
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:15,513
Well, I'm impressed.

418
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,894
- I've been seeing your photos.
- Yeah, it's going really great.

419
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,147
How about you, how's your job?

420
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:29,110
Great. Loving it.

421
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:34,824
How do you think it's going?

422
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,326
Terrible. They're not even sniffing
each other.

423
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:38,995
Alvin. Dave said that--

424
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:42,749
Dave needs a little help
from the love doctor.

425
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,167
And his assistant.

426
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,085
Get back here.

427
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,254
You know, this is nice.

428
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,632
Just two friends having dinner.
Hanging out.

429
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:54,761
No pressure. Nothing weird.

430
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:06,355
My stereo does that all the time.
It's like it has a mind of its own.

431
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,857
You were saying?

432
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:12,403
Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous
about coming over here.

433
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,406
I wasn't sure if you thought
this was a date or something.

434
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,992
A date? No.

435
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,002
The wiring in my unit is shot.

436
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,172
You should get an electrician
to fix that.

437
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,509
I don't need anyone
to fix anything for me.

438
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,765
Okay.

439
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:48,731
Could you excuse me for a moment?
I'm gonna go check the fuse box.

440
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,449
H9)'-

441
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,828
Look, I know what you guys
are up to. Alvin.

442
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,121
- Breath check.
- Where's Al--?

443
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,334
Dave, are you okay?

444
00:36:08,501 --> 00:36:09,836
Everything's fine.

445
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,296
Why did you do that?

446
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:16,092
I was just trying to help, Dave.
You have garlic breath.

447
00:36:16,843 --> 00:36:19,554
Well, stop helping.
You're ruining everything.

448
00:36:23,057 --> 00:36:24,725
I think I got something in my eye.

449
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,228
Here. Let me see.

450
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:33,734
Yeah. It looks really irritated.
It's so red. What happened?

451
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,736
What was that?

452
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,196
Oh, I thought I saw a rat.

453
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:38,656
- A rat?
- Probably nothing.

454
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:40,867
Here, let's finish eating, huh?

455
00:36:42,577 --> 00:36:44,829
Tomorrow, I'm gonna call
the exterminator.

456
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,543
- What?
- Claire.

457
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,128
Dave? Dave?

458
00:36:52,295 --> 00:36:55,339
- Tell her she completes you.
- What are you doing?

459
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:57,383
- You got it, Dave.
- Dave.

460
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,593
Dave, let go.

461
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,805
I'm sorry, Claire. It's just

462
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:07,018
I lost my job, Claire.

463
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:08,728
And I guess I just needed a hug.

464
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,064
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Tell me what happened.

465
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,443
Well, this is gonna sound
really strange.

466
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,529
No games. No fooling around.

467
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,241
- The truth?
- Please, I'm begging you.

468
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,665
My life is being sabotaged
by talking chipmunks.

469
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,883
- You know what?
- I'm not crazy, I swear.

470
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,801
You haven't changed at all.

471
00:37:43,554 --> 00:37:48,684
Wait. Claire. Don't go. I can explain.

472
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,148
Chipmunks.

473
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,986
You should've kissed her, Dave.

474
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,237
She wanted you.

475
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:01,948
Alvin, you're not helping.

476
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,282
Don't give up, Dave.

477
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,909
Go away. Leave me alone.

478
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,286
Dave, would you like a cookie?

479
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,956
I said, leave me alone.

480
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:17,380
Is it me, or was he a little mad?

481
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,340
I wonder, is Dave mad? Yes.

482
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,175
He really did have garlic breath.

483
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,885
Yeah, well-played, guys.

484
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,845
Idea.

485
00:38:25,012 --> 00:38:26,222
Who has cab fare?

486
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:29,600
Cab fare?
We don't even have pockets.

487
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:58,254
<i>Dear fellas, I'm sorry,
but this isn't really working out.</i>

488
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,633
<i>I don't know what made me think
I could handle you guys...</i>

489
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,177
<i>...when I can barely manage
my own life.</i>

490
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:08,764
<i>You should go back to your real home
in the forest.</i>

491
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:11,058
<i>That's what's best for all of us.</i>

492
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:14,520
<i>I'm sorry it has to be this way, but...</i>

493
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,167
Guys?

494
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:39,670
Simon, Theodore?

495
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,675
Guys?

496
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,138
Alvin?

497
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,268
Alvin!

498
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,732
Simon?

499
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,361
Theodore?

500
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,989
Alvin?

501
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,658
Alvin.

502
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,806
Hello?

503
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,475
Hello?

504
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:36,977
Kids.

505
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:46,362
<i>Christmas, Christmastime is near</i>

506
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:51,200
<i>Time for toys and time for cheer</i>

507
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:55,871
<i>We can't hardly stand the wait</i>

508
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:59,333
<i>Please, Christmas, don't be late</i>

509
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,546
Welcome to Jett Records.

510
00:41:17,852 --> 00:41:20,604
Okay. New rule.
No going out after 9.

511
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:23,107
And not at all unless
I know where you're going.

512
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:24,984
Were you worried about us, Dave?

513
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,986
No. I just need to know, that's all.

514
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:30,489
Wait. If you're not worried,
then why do you need to know?

515
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,075
I need to know, okay?

516
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:43,961
Alvin.

517
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:52,428
Oh, sorry about that. Yeah.

518
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,263
- Sorry.
- Kids, huh?

519
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:56,640
They keep you on your toes.
Do you have any?

520
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,100
Three boys.

521
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,269
Well, some days
are better than others.

522
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:03,022
And some days
you just wanna close them in a box...

523
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:05,941
...leave the box in the park
and run away, you know?

524
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,286
Quick, hide.

525
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,290
Guys, what's all this?

526
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,334
Toaster waffles.

527
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:26,086
You know, I can't afford
all these toaster waffles.

528
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:29,131
- What?
- Well, in case you didn't notice...

529
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:30,758
...I don't have a job anymo--

530
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,268
My song?

531
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:44,647
- All right.
- Yeah.

532
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:52,780
- Hello?
- Hey, Dave.

533
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,450
Hey, how's my favorite songwriter?

534
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,786
- Ian?
<i>- Tell me you've heard the song</i>

535
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:01,080
Yeah. I'm listening to it right now.

536
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,623
How did you--? When did--?

537
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,835
Speed of business, baby.
That's how we do it. That's how I roll.

538
00:43:07,002 --> 00:43:10,005
Got a friend in satellite radio,
put it in immediate rotation.

539
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:14,510
And that video of your little guys,
10 million hits already on YouTube.

540
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,181
It's crazy. I gotta go.

541
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:22,685
Hey, put some clothes on those guys.
It's kind of embarrassing.

542
00:43:28,232 --> 00:43:30,526
We owed you, Dave.

543
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:35,322
So we're good
with the toaster waffles, right? Dave?

544
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,151
Soup's on.

545
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,546
Alvin.

546
00:44:43,974 --> 00:44:45,684
So, what do you think?

547
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:47,144
Cool.

548
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,343
All right.

549
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:28,852
Toothbrush, huh? Okay.

550
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,650
No.

551
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,917
Dave...

552
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,420
...are you awake?

553
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,671
I am now.

554
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:57,172
I had a nightmare.

555
00:45:58,507 --> 00:46:00,217
Can I sleep with you?

556
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,263
You won't even know I'm here.

557
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,474
Okay. Sure.
But stay on that side of the bed.

558
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:10,144
Oh, okay.

559
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:28,036
Theodore, that's not your side
of the bed.

560
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:52,895
- Theodore, wake up. It's Christmas.
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.

561
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:54,271
Boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

562
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,523
<i>On the first day of Christmas
Dave woke up</i>

563
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,817
Come on, man, it's Christmas.
Hallelujah.

564
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,319
Wake up, lazy bones.

565
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,946
Oh, yeah. Christmas.

566
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,449
- Up and at them.
- You can sleep when you're dead.

567
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:06,867
- I'm coming
- Come on, Dave.

568
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,076
Hurry up, Dad.

569
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:11,955
- Dad?
- Dave. I said Dave.

570
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:14,625
This is shaping up to be
my favorite Christmas ever.

571
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:17,044
- You want to open mine first.
- Open mine first.

572
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:19,796
- No, Dave, mine is better.
- You guys got me presents?

573
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,798
Of course.

574
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,845
All right. Simon?

575
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,185
Wow, it's a--

576
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:34,853
It's a paper-clip compass.

577
00:47:35,437 --> 00:47:38,315
A paper-clip compass.
Now I'll never get lost.

578
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:39,775
Me next.

579
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,485
Alvin.

580
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:48,867
- My wallet.
- Do you like it'?

581
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,828
Really? I wanted to get you something
you'd use every day.

582
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:55,082
And I have been using this
for almost 10 years now.

583
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:57,501
Very thoughtful, Alvin. Thank you.

584
00:47:57,668 --> 00:48:00,546
Yeah, the look on your face
says it all, Dave.

585
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:05,008
Oh, nicely done, Theodore.
"To Dav."

586
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:11,181
Let's see, it says, "Merry Christmas.
Love, Theodore."

587
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:14,977
And it's got a nice picture
of some pineapples?

588
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,646
Those aren't pineapples.
That's our family.

589
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:25,028
Look, fellas. Let's make sure
we understand each other here.

590
00:48:25,404 --> 00:48:26,863
I'm not your...

591
00:48:28,532 --> 00:48:31,660
You know,
your dad or anything, right?

592
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,662
But you're like a dad.

593
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,293
Well, not really.

594
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:42,045
I mean, we're friends for sure.

595
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:45,340
And I write your music, you know,
manage your career.

596
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,843
- Make us sweaters.
- Feed us.

597
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,887
Let us sleep in your bed
when we have nightmares.

598
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,223
That's what friends do.

599
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:58,020
So who wants to open their presents?

600
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,397
- Is that a trick question? We do.
- Yeah.

601
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:02,399
- Presents.
- Oh, boy.

602
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:03,984
Presents. Presents. Presents.

603
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:06,153
I can't wait to open mine first.

604
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,613
Envelope.

605
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,659
They're savings bonds.

606
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:14,161
Cool.

607
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:18,206
You know, in seven years, you're
gonna get to buy something really nice.

608
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:22,210
Do you maybe have any
that you bought seven years ago?

609
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:26,506
- Alvin, manners.
- Thank you, Dave.

610
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:29,176
Yeah. Thanks, Dave.

611
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:35,682
- Ian?
- Who wants presents?

612
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,809
- All right.
- Cool.

613
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:40,145
Hey, there's plenty more
where this came from.

614
00:49:40,312 --> 00:49:41,772
Bring them on in, fellas.

615
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:43,899
- Oh, yeah.
- Jackpot.

616
00:49:44,066 --> 00:49:45,901
What are you doing?

617
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:49,196
- Taking care of my boys.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

618
00:49:49,363 --> 00:49:51,323
Weird. What happened
to your presents?

619
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:54,201
- Which one is mine?
- That big one is for me, I think.

620
00:49:54,368 --> 00:49:55,494
What did you get them?

621
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:57,621
Savings bonds.

622
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:59,915
Great. Just what every kid dreams of.

623
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:02,250
You're in luck.
Your Uncle Ian came through.

624
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,253
- Cool.
- Uncle Ian?

625
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,256
Is-- Is this for me?

626
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:09,925
No, it's for Simon.

627
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:12,511
- Theodore.
- Oh, boy.

628
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:17,808
- And Alvin.
- Thank you, Santa.

629
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,477
This is for you.
You like the Oak Ridge Boys, right?

630
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,187
Yeah, you're welcome.

631
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:23,689
And guess what, guys.

632
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,401
Uncle Ian is gonna have
a big launch party for the new CD.

633
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:31,613
That's right. Press, paparazzi.
Hollywood hotshots.

634
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,115
The whole nine yards.

635
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,449
- Awesome.
- Sweet.

636
00:50:34,616 --> 00:50:38,286
Yeah. Dave, you've got one week
to write me a new hit single.

637
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,247
All right? Something funky and fresh.

638
00:50:40,414 --> 00:50:42,666
- Peace. We out.
- Bye, Uncle Ian.

639
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,836
- Merry Christmas.
- Now it really is Christmas.

640
00:50:46,002 --> 00:50:48,463
Mayday, mayday-

641
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:52,050
This way, this way, this way.

642
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:56,805
All right. All right. Settle in, settle in.
Thank you for coming.

643
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,725
It is a very special night tonight.

644
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:05,814
Here at Jett Records, we pride ourselves
on bringing you tomorrow's music today.

645
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:08,900
Oh, and guess what. I did it again.

646
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:12,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
here to sing their new hit single...

647
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:19,703
...give it up
for Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

648
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:22,539
<i>Yeah, in the place to be</i>

649
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:27,127
<i>Chipmunks on the M-I-C
"Witch Doctor"</i>

650
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,879
<i>Everybody, can they do it?</i>

651
00:51:29,045 --> 00:51:30,505
<i>Can they do it?</i>

652
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:32,716
<i>Come on, people, let's get to it</i>

653
00:51:32,883 --> 00:51:33,967
<i>Let's get to it</i>

654
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:37,846
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor</i>

655
00:51:38,013 --> 00:51:42,476
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go</i>

656
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:46,146
<i>I told the witch doctor
I was in love with you</i>

657
00:51:46,313 --> 00:51:49,649
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me too</i>

658
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:52,903
<i>And then the witch doctor
He told me what to do</i>

659
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:55,572
<i>He said:
Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

660
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:57,657
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

661
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:01,286
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

662
00:52:01,453 --> 00:52:03,038
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

663
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:05,290
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

664
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:09,252
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

665
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,754
<i>Yo, DJ, pump this par!)/-'</i>

666
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:12,881
<i>Everybody, can they do it?</i>

667
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,674
<i>- Can they do it?
- Go! Go! Go!</i>

668
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,510
<i>Come on, people, let's get to it</i>

669
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,178
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

670
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:22,057
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
Everybody hit the floor</i>

671
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:25,602
<i>Come on, shake, come on, roll
With the Chipmunks, here we go</i>

672
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:28,313
<i>Alvin! Simon! Theodore!</i>

673
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,108
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me true</i>

674
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:35,821
<i>I told the witch doctor
You didn't love me nice</i>

675
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,657
<i>And then the witch doctor
He gave me this advice</i>

676
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:40,617
<i>He said to me:</i>

677
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:47,123
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

678
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:51,169
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

679
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:54,381
<i>You've been keeping love from me</i>

680
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:58,468
<i>- And that's not very smart
- Not very smart</i>

681
00:52:58,635 --> 00:53:04,307
<i>I went out and found myself someone
Who'd tell me how to win your heart</i>

682
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,148
<i>My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to say</i>

683
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:15,944
<i>My friend the witch doctor
He told me what to do</i>

684
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:20,156
<i>I know that you'll be mine
When I say this to you</i>

685
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:24,953
<i>- Oh, baby, baby!
- Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

686
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,205
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:30,876
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah

688
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,752
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah</i>

689
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,754
<i>To the ting to the tang
The wallawalla bingbang</i>

690
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,550
<i>Ooh to the eeh the ooh the ah ah
Ting tang wallawalla bingbang</i>

691
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:46,349
Yeah.

692
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:52,063
All right, party people.
You know how we do it.

693
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,400
Get on that dance floor,
let me see what you got.

694
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:06,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

695
00:54:06,536 --> 00:54:08,747
- You mind if I grab a few pics?
- Claire.

696
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,000
- Not at all. Fire away.
- Great.

697
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:16,087
I've got a new assignment.
I'm covering your rise to fame.

698
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:21,217
- Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore.
- Hi.

699
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:22,761
- Hello.
- Hi, Claire.

700
00:54:22,928 --> 00:54:24,429
You're hot.

701
00:54:25,347 --> 00:54:27,390
Forgot you guys haven't officially met.

702
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:33,897
So, Dave...

703
00:54:34,064 --> 00:54:36,942
...I'm sorry about that night.
I really thought that you--

704
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,276
That I was insane?

705
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:40,654
I totally understand it.

706
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,032
Talking chipmunks.
It's a lot to take in over dinner.

707
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:49,162
But look at you now. You've got
the career, promising future, kids.

708
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:50,413
You're like a family.

709
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,708
Don't say "family" in front of Dave.
It gives him gas.

710
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:57,796
- Like, clear-the-room gas.
- Does not.

711
00:54:57,963 --> 00:54:59,631
He doesn't want a family.

712
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:02,717
Why don't you guys go and play
or raid the dessert table?

713
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:04,719
Don't take it personally, you guys.

714
00:55:04,886 --> 00:55:07,597
Some people don't know a good thing
when they've got it.

715
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:09,516
Right, Dave?

716
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:12,686
Claire.

717
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:17,357
No offense, big guy,
but you are not good at this.

718
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:26,324
Hey, what do you think of this?

719
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,160
- What is it?
- It's Alvin.

720
00:55:29,327 --> 00:55:31,121
That looks nothing like Alvin.

721
00:55:31,287 --> 00:55:34,833
Well, yeah. It's a prototype.
We'll sell a million of these things.

722
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,836
It's voice-activated.
Here, say something to it.

723
00:55:38,712 --> 00:55:43,550
Hello, ugly little Alvin doll
that looks nothing like Alvin.

724
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:48,805
- See? You love it. It's Spanish.
- You know what? That's just weird.

725
00:55:48,972 --> 00:55:50,390
Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave.

726
00:55:50,557 --> 00:55:52,809
We've got to expand
the Munks' fan base.

727
00:55:52,976 --> 00:55:55,437
I mean, forget about the music.

728
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:59,357
The music is but a means
to the big money, okay?

729
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:03,153
I'm talking about our own
fur clothing line, cologne.

730
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:06,322
Chipmunk Heat, something like that.
Chipmunk wine coolers.

731
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,949
- I mean--
- They're just kids.

732
00:56:08,116 --> 00:56:09,367
No, they're rats.

733
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:12,829
And they could make us both
so much money...

734
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:17,751
...if you just let me work with them.
- I can't hear you, the music's too loud.

735
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:23,256
Don't go against me on this, Dave.
I never lose.

736
00:56:31,598 --> 00:56:34,392
Has anyone tried
the chocolate meatballs?

737
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,645
I'll probably go into insulin shock.
But it's worth it.

738
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:41,483
Oh, a sweet, sweet,
sweet molasses meat.

739
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:45,737
Hey, Alvster. Love the song, bro.

740
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:48,531
- Up top.
- What's up, player?

741
00:56:49,115 --> 00:56:52,702
So I see you're enjoying my little spread
that I've put out for you guys.

742
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:56,039
What am I talking about?
You probably eat like this all the time.

743
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:58,708
Well, Dave says
he doesn't wanna spoil us.

744
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:02,462
Dude, you're a rock star.
You're supposed to be spoiled.

745
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:06,007
I mean, you should be riding
in limousines and private planes.

746
00:57:06,174 --> 00:57:09,844
And you should be going to parties
like this every night.

747
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:12,138
Really?
Because Dave says we need our sleep.

748
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:17,894
Look, Alvin, this is hard to say
but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it.

749
00:57:18,061 --> 00:57:22,941
Dave's holding you back, you know.
I could be making you 20 large a day.

750
00:57:23,108 --> 00:57:25,735
- Is that a lot?
- Yes.

751
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,613
Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you.
I will tell you.

752
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,826
Look, behind your back,
Dave calls you...

753
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:35,245
..."the rats."

754
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,667
- Rats?
- Yeah. Whatever, right? I know.

755
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:44,712
Well, don't let it bother you.
I mean, me? I consider you boys family.

756
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:47,507
And if there's anything you need,
anything at all...

757
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:50,718
...give your uncle Ian a call, all right?

758
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:54,222
- Oh, right.
- Ciao.

759
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:01,938
Come on, pal.
You drive like my grandmother.

760
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:03,690
Get a wheelchair. Move over!

761
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:09,654
Hey, guys, look at me.
Up, up and away.

762
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,950
Alvin.

763
00:58:14,492 --> 00:58:17,579
Can't help you, Simon.
I'm about to take the lead here.

764
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:19,873
Hey, guys,
I have an idea for a new song.

765
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:22,584
Hey, Dave.

766
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:25,879
What's going on in here?
I thought I told you guys to clean up.

767
00:58:26,045 --> 00:58:27,714
We are.

768
00:58:31,885 --> 00:58:35,597
- Who's that?
- Uncle Ian hired us a housekeeper.

769
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,891
She's also a masseuse.

770
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:43,897
Come on, move over, road hog.

771
00:58:44,063 --> 00:58:46,900
Drive it or park it, pal.
Get in the slow lane.

772
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:49,277
- Where did you get that game?
- Uncle Ian.

773
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:52,363
Move it or lose it!
Get some training wheels, buddy.

774
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:54,657
Okay, you know what?

775
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:56,618
That's enough.

776
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,662
What are you doing?
I was about to beat my high score.

777
00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:02,207
Too bad. Where's Theodore?

778
00:59:05,877 --> 00:59:07,503
Spit it out.

779
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:10,048
- Spit it out.
- No.

780
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:13,009
Jett Records.

781
00:59:13,551 --> 00:59:17,597
Okay. That's it. Meeting. Now.
Everyone on the couch.

782
00:59:18,223 --> 00:59:20,350
Could you give us a minute?

783
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:27,357
Guys, look, it's hard, I know.

784
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:31,945
Three months ago, you were hanging out
in a tree somewhere and now you're--

785
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:35,073
Major rock stars.

786
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,159
Okay. Whatever.
My point is just because you're--

787
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:39,994
Major rock stars.

788
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,833
Doesn't mean you can have or do
whatever you want.

789
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,544
Well, Uncle Ian says
we should always be happy.

790
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,296
Okay, you know what?

791
00:59:50,463 --> 00:59:52,799
He's not your uncle.

792
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:58,721
He also, David, said
that we should be making $20 a day.

793
00:59:58,888 --> 01:00:01,140
Guess what.
You're making way more than that.

794
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:04,018
And because I care,
I'm putting it all away for you.

795
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,229
Just like storing nuts for the winter.

796
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:08,231
Oh, winter's for losers.

797
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:11,901
Yeah. Shouldn't we have a say
in how to build our investment portfolio?

798
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,072
Where is all this coming from?
You guys are just kids.

799
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,867
- Kids, Dave, or rats?
- What?

800
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,829
Well, Uncle Ian says
we're like his family.

801
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:25,832
Oh, yeah?
Well, if you love Uncle Ian so much...

802
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:28,167
...and don't think I'm watching out
for you...

803
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:30,503
...why don't you go live
with Uncle Ian?

804
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:43,266
Dave?

805
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:45,601
Are you still mad at us?

806
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:48,521
Dave?

807
01:00:57,864 --> 01:01:01,075
Dear fellas, I'm sorry, but

808
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:05,288
You should go back
to your real home in the forest."

809
01:01:05,455 --> 01:01:08,291
I guess he really does want us to go.

810
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:22,013
I told you, Dave.

811
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,182
I never lose.

812
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:55,129
Boys, welcome to your new home.

813
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:05,014
- Oh, yeah. Daddy's home.
- Yeah.

814
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:07,475
Can we play with all this stuff?

815
01:02:07,642 --> 01:02:10,019
Sure, why not? It's your house.

816
01:02:10,186 --> 01:02:12,563
So, what are the rules around here?

817
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:16,651
Oh, I do have one rule...

818
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:19,946
...that there are no rules!
- Cool.

819
01:02:31,249 --> 01:02:33,376
Four degrees elevation.

820
01:02:33,543 --> 01:02:35,878
Six degrees azimuth.

821
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:39,048
Fire!

822
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:53,521
Prepare to face the fury
of my vengeance.

823
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:55,815
Don't make me laugh.

824
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:58,484
Pray for a quick demise,
young chipmunk.

825
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:00,945
Uppercut. Left. Fake-out, fake-out.

826
01:03:09,704 --> 01:03:13,374
Your kung fu is no match
for my rockets.

827
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:16,544
Sneak attack.

828
01:03:19,255 --> 01:03:21,007
Okay, Simon. That's enough.

829
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,593
I'm finished now. Simon.

830
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:25,803
- Hey, give me that.
- Let go, Alvin.

831
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,054
Oh, come on.

832
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,101
- You had a turn.
- Who says you get a turn?

833
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:33,519
Give me that.

834
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:38,441
Simon!

835
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,902
- You got to try.
- Get your mangy paws off of it.

836
01:03:43,905 --> 01:03:45,448
- Scram.
- I want it.

837
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:47,617
Alvin, you don't decide.

838
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:04,884
- Why didn't the airbags deploy?
- Theodore, don't go into the light.

839
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,887
- Let's do it again.
- Awesome.

840
01:04:08,054 --> 01:04:09,972
- Playing hard?
- Oh, yes.

841
01:04:10,139 --> 01:04:11,891
Good.

842
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:16,938
Because tomorrow, you start working
hard. Coast to coast in five days.

843
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:20,441
Well, Dave says that touring is no life
for a kid.

844
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:23,319
For a normal kid.
You guys are superstars.

845
01:04:23,486 --> 01:04:25,488
- Yes.
- Which reminds me...

846
01:04:25,655 --> 01:04:28,574
...Simon, let's get rid of these
boring glasses.

847
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:34,997
And try on these super cool
in-the-now glasses.

848
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:37,083
Oh, my God, oh.

849
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:40,253
These would be great
if I could see out of them.

850
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:44,298
Your eyes will adjust.
Come on, boys. Let's hit the road.

851
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:45,925
- Shotgun.
- Hit the road.

852
01:04:46,092 --> 01:04:47,635
Alvin--

853
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,771
Give me a big fella. Alvin, big, big.

854
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:44,817
No hiding. Come on, come on.
Make love to the camera.

855
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:50,114
Sell it. Big smile. Yes.
Theodore, chin out. Yeah. That's it.

856
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:53,159
Good stuff. There you go.
Come on, get in there.

857
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:55,369
Strong. Give me some booty.

858
01:05:55,536 --> 01:05:58,748
Spank it. There you got it.
Now you got it.

859
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:10,551
If the Chipmunks like Crunchy Nibbles,
your pet will love them.

860
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:12,428
Cut.

861
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,764
Here we are.

862
01:06:16,474 --> 01:06:18,267
Okay? All right?

863
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:03,062
Hold it.

864
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,355
We're not done.

865
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:05,815
- You tell me.
- Killing me.

866
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:08,067
- What do you want?
- You are killing me here.

867
01:07:08,234 --> 01:07:11,112
There's no button I can push
that wakes them to sing notes.

868
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,197
You kidding?
There's 5000 buttons here.

869
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:16,158
- What button do you want me to push?
- Fine. I've got it.

870
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:22,164
All right, guys. Guess what your
uncle Ian brought you. Coffee.

871
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:24,959
I love toffee.

872
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:30,673
No, it's coffee, Theodore, coffee. It's a--
Like a super cool energy health drink...

873
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:37,722
...with whipped cream and caramel
and two pumps of chocolate.

874
01:07:38,055 --> 01:07:39,932
Enjoy.

875
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:44,270
That ought to keep them awake.

876
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,275
<i>- Get munk'd
- Go, go, go</i>

877
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:34,820
<i>Yeah, Chipmunks
Always can get munk'd</i>

878
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:36,739
<i>H6)/, /79)/, hey</i>

879
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:39,200
<i>Come and get munk'd
With the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

880
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:42,912
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks
Get munk'd with the Chipmunk rugrats</i>

881
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,747
<i>Come and get munk'd with the Munks</i>

882
01:08:44,914 --> 01:08:48,667
Stop, stop. Come on, guys.
We need more energy, okay?

883
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:53,547
We need more dry ice. We need more,
you know, wow. All right?

884
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:55,674
We're the Chipmunks,
for crying out loud.

885
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,636
This is absurd.
I feel like P. Diddy with fur.

886
01:08:58,803 --> 01:09:02,473
And to be honest, the new songs
don't really sound like us.

887
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,310
Well, you know what I think? I think
the new direction is perfect, you know.

888
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,521
It's all about today's edge.

889
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:10,898
Dave always said
it was all about the music.

890
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:12,358
"Dave always said..."

891
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:17,655
You know what? Dave, Dave, Dave.
Dave is not here, okay? It's me.

892
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:21,742
It's fun Uncle Ian, all right? Okay?

893
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:26,914
What are you--? What are you
gonna say? What's your name?

894
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:30,000
- Taffy.
- Taffy? What kind of name is Taffy?

895
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,544
What do you do?

896
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,713
- Choreography.
- I don't know what "choreography" is.

897
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,466
- What is that?
- It's dance.

898
01:09:37,633 --> 01:09:43,389
Oh, is it dancing? Well, next time say,
you know, "I'm the dance guy--" Hello?

899
01:09:43,806 --> 01:09:47,393
Who? Dave Seville.

900
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:50,062
Name rings a bell. A dead...

901
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:51,522
<i>...broken bell.</i>

902
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:55,025
<i>- Just let me talk to the guys.
- I don't think that's such a good idea.</i>

903
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:58,654
The boys are still stinging a little bit
from you kicking them out.

904
01:09:58,821 --> 01:10:01,991
- That's not what happened.
- Denial.

905
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:04,577
So, what's this I hear
about a European tour?

906
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:07,288
You're taking them away
for six months?

907
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:10,541
No, 12 actually.
If we can get China to go chipmunk.

908
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,459
Twelve?

909
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:15,713
Look, I just wanted to say hi.
See how they're doing.

910
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,882
They're doing great.
They're loving life.

911
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:19,508
<i>Living large.</i>

912
01:10:19,675 --> 01:10:22,845
Face it, Dave. They've moved on.

913
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:26,056
- They're happy now.
- Look, Ian, I wanna talk to them.

914
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:27,308
<i>Put them on the phone.</i>

915
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:29,935
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna happen, Dave.

916
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:32,062
<i>Got a world tour,
gonna start tomorrow.</i>

917
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,481
And these guys don't need
the extra pressure.

918
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:37,192
<i>- We'll send you</i> a <i>postcard</i>
- Ian, <i>you can't</i> do <i>this.</i>

919
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,446
They're not ready for something
like that. They're just kids.

920
01:10:40,613 --> 01:10:43,574
- I'm gonna see them.
- Look, Dave, I'm-- Wait.

921
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:44,867
- Ian?
- Yeah? What?

922
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:47,077
- Ian.
- I can't--

923
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:55,336
Ian...

924
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,171
...was that Dave?

925
01:11:00,174 --> 01:11:03,218
Yes. Yes, it was.

926
01:11:03,385 --> 01:11:06,055
He wanted me to let you know
he's great and he's happy.

927
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:09,099
He's really, really happy. So... All right.

928
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,977
And is he coming to the show?

929
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,484
You know what? I sent him tickets.
And here's the thing, he sent them back.

930
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:23,781
Yeah, I know. I guess he's busy,
you know. Got better things to do.

931
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:26,367
Hey, come on.
What's with the long furry faces?

932
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:28,911
We're gonna have fun.
We're gonna have a big show.

933
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:32,331
I'll tell you what, you guys like
deep-tissue massage? All right?

934
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:35,209
I know a guy. Let me call my guy.
I'll get on that.

935
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:38,170
Hey, captain, come here.

936
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:39,463
Listen.

937
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:43,175
Dave Seville.
Learn the name, look for the face.

938
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:46,553
If he shows up tomorrow night,
he doesn't get near my chipmunks.

939
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,598
- Got it? Okay.
- Got it.

940
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:05,114
Uncle Ian?

941
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,999
- What are you doing here?
- Can I sleep with you?

942
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,542
I had a nightmare.

943
01:12:16,959 --> 01:12:20,254
Oh, you had a nightmare?

944
01:12:20,421 --> 01:12:23,590
I had a nightmare too.
In my nightmare...

945
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:30,139
...I had to put together 37 dates
in 42 days, in 16 different countries.

946
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:35,477
And I had to coordinate 121
different radio and print interviews...

947
01:12:35,644 --> 01:12:38,022
...in five different languages.

948
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:41,066
But you know what, Theo?
The only difference is...

949
01:12:41,233 --> 01:12:46,780
...in my nightmare, when I open
my eyes, it doesn't end.

950
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:49,992
So is that a no?

951
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,483
Guys...

952
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:24,651
...I wanna go home.

953
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:27,154
What do you mean? You are home.

954
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:29,990
No, I mean, "home" home.

955
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:32,201
You know, with Dave.

956
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:36,080
But, Theodore, come on.
Wake up and smell the toffee.

957
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:42,252
Dave doesn't even want us. He doesn't
care enough to even come to our show.

958

<i>Too tired to rock?
The Chipmunks might be.</i>

960
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:54,348
<i>Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are
swirling around the singing sensation.</i>

961
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:58,685
<i>Is it because of toaster waffle overload?
Or a rigorous tour schedule?</i>

962
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,356
<i>It's hard to say. But manager-producer
Ian Hawke has assured Fox...</i>

Okay.

967
01:14:40,936 --> 01:14:44,606
You three sound like
you've been gargling nails.

968
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:48,402
- I'll cover for you.
- Thank you.

969
01:14:49,528 --> 01:14:51,363
Can we get Wardrobe
down here, please?

970
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,115
Well?

971
01:14:53,282 --> 01:14:58,036
I could give you a lot of fancy terms,
but, bottom line, they're exhausted.

972
01:14:58,203 --> 01:15:01,957
Okay, well, give them a shot
or a cream or a pill or something.

973
01:15:02,124 --> 01:15:05,460
I've invested every dime I have
in these guys.

974
01:15:05,627 --> 01:15:08,088
They need a long rest.

975
01:15:08,255 --> 01:15:12,593
A long rest. Are you--? Okay.
Yeah, a long rest, right.

976
01:15:12,885 --> 01:15:15,179
Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so...

977
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:18,140
I'll get them that rest. Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

978
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:21,226
Thank you so much. I will--
I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc.

979
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:23,604

Knock, knock.

981
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:31,445
So listen, guys,
I just talked to the doctor.

982
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:34,656
And I don't feel right about
sending you guys out like this.

983
01:15:35,282 --> 01:15:37,409
So you're gonna cancel the show?

984
01:15:37,993 --> 01:15:41,079
No. No,
then I'd have to give out refunds.

985
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:45,500
No. What I'm talking about
is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah.

986
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:47,127
Isn't that like cheating?

987
01:15:47,294 --> 01:15:50,964
No, it's not like cheating. it's--
Cheating is wrong.

988
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:54,426
This is more like helping.
Yeah, all the superstars do it.

989
01:15:54,593 --> 01:15:58,513
Just make sure that you mouth the
words exactly like we recorded them.

990
01:15:58,680 --> 01:16:01,433
- Otherwise, people will know.
- That we're cheating.

991
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,980
- No.
- Guys, what other choice do we have?

992
01:16:07,147 --> 01:16:10,442
Yeah. See?
That's why he's the one with the letter.

993
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:12,569
All right, guys, tighten up.

994
01:16:12,736 --> 01:16:18,116
And remember, mouth the words
and no one will know.

995
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:19,868

No, there's no Dave Seville
on this list.

- No, I don't think so.
- He's with me.

1021
01:18:02,346 --> 01:18:04,348
He's my assistant.

1022
01:18:05,432 --> 01:18:06,600
Okay.

1023
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:08,143
Thanks, Claire.

What are you--?

1025
01:18:13,398 --> 01:18:16,777
I gotta get my boys back
but Ian's trying to keep me out.

Your boys.

1027
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,281
I know that probably sounds weird
coming from me.

1028
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:23,658
It's a good weird, though.

1029
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,287
Because after all I did to mess up
everything, including you--

1030
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:32,584
- Dave, your boys. We should go.

Alvin, what are you doing?

01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:28,140
I'm sending a message
to our dear old uncle Ian.

01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:31,643
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Me too.

1046
01:19:37,816 --> 01:19:39,443
Come on, guys.

1047

Come on, right there. Perfect.

1069
01:20:59,356 --> 01:21:01,858
He'll feel that in the morning.

1071

You're not going anywhere.

1072
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,701
What are you doing?

1073
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:14,287
- Put us down.

1074
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:16,289
- Hey.

01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:24,589
- Let us out of here. Let us out of here.
- No.

1078
01:21:24,756 --> 01:21:27,717
What? Ian, they don't want this
any more. Just let them go.

1079
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,681
But the guy just left. You should have
said something about five seconds ago.

1080

Come back.

1081
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:39,604
Ian, they need a real life.
Not all of this.

1082
01:21:39,771 --> 01:21:42,190
Besides, they just ruined the concert.

1083
01:21:42,357 --> 01:21:45,944
Word will get out,
no one will come to see them.

1084
01:21:46,570 --> 01:21:51,950
Dave, they're chipmunks who talk.
People will come.

1085
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:54,160
Guys, with me.

01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:12,178
They just did take us alive, Alvin.

1089
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,180
It's a figure of speech, Simon.

1090
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:18,435
Instead of criticizing me, why not use
your big brain to think of a way out?

1091
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:33,450
Go, go, go. Go.

1092
01:22:42,834 --> 01:22:44,628
Come on.

1093
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:55,013
Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.

1094
01:23:04,773 --> 01:23:06,650
How did you guys--7'

1095
01:23:06,816 --> 01:23:08,318
We are talking chipmunks, Dave.

1096
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:13,114
We can get out of a cat carrier.
Not even hard to do.

1097
01:23:13,281 --> 01:23:15,158
You came back for us.

1098
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:19,913
Well, of course I came back.
We're a family.

1099
01:23:20,538 --> 01:23:22,082
Holy nuts.

1100
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:25,001
- What?
- Am I going crazy?

1101
01:23:25,168 --> 01:23:26,753
Or did he just say "family"?

1102
01:23:28,421 --> 01:23:31,299
I know...

1103
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,928
...but I really missed you guys.

1104
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:37,097
I missed you too, Dave.

1105
01:23:39,307 --> 01:23:41,017
Me too.

1106
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:47,190
- So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it.
- Yeah, too macho.

1107
01:23:48,483 --> 01:23:51,194
Missed you too.

1108
01:23:51,361 --> 01:23:54,280
Sorry, I had some sentimentality
stuck in my throat.

1109
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:58,535
I just said, I missed you too.

1110
01:23:58,702 --> 01:24:00,662
Whatever.
Who are you guys to judge me?

1111
01:24:00,829 --> 01:24:04,082
Okay, you know what?
I miss my friend Dave, okay?

1112
01:24:04,249 --> 01:24:08,545
I'll scream it from the rooftops.
And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed.

1113
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:11,881
That's right. I love you, Dave.

1114
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,593
Come here.

1115
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,433
- Dave?
- Yes, Alvin?

1116
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:24,269
Now can I steer?
Oh, please, please, please.

1117
01:24:24,436 --> 01:24:27,981
- I want to work the windshield wipers.
- Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.

1118
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:30,358
Have at it, fellas.

1119
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:34,279
- I'm a good beeper.
- Save some horn for the rest of us.

1120
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:37,574
- Come on, Dave, drive faster.
- Not with you steering.

1121
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:39,909
Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.

1122
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:43,079
- Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
- Enough of what? Of being awesome?

1123
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:44,581
Alvin, I said that's enough.

1124
01:24:44,748 --> 01:24:47,292
Hey, look, Dave, no paws.

1125
01:24:49,419 --> 01:24:54,924
Hey, if you guys behave, maybe
I'll let you call me "Uncle lan" again.

1126
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:56,676
Deal?

1127
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:23,453
No!

1128
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:32,212
Claire.

1129
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:33,463
- Hey.
- Come on in.

1130
01:25:35,465 --> 01:25:37,842
- Hi, Claire.
- Well, hello, Clarina.

1131
01:25:38,009 --> 01:25:40,011
- Hi, guys.
- Hope you like toaster waffles.

1132
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:44,307
And, for us classy chipmunks,
a bit of the bubbly.

1133
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:48,311
Stupid cork. Doesn't--

1134
01:25:54,984 --> 01:25:56,903
I'm not gonna say it.

1135
01:25:58,488 --> 01:25:59,572
Good grief.

1136
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:03,326
Are you still not gonna say it?

1137
01:26:03,493 --> 01:26:04,661
Nope.

1138
01:26:08,873 --> 01:26:14,921
I'm gonna say it. Alvin!

1139
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:16,923
Okay!

1140
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:25,009
www.YTS.AG

1141
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,064
Okay, guys, come on,
let's try it again.

1142
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,859
Here we go, and sing.

1143
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:40,822
Come on, sing for your uncle Ian.
Come on, sing.

1144
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:43,616
Why--? Why won't you sing?

1145
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:46,160
You know, I said, sing.

1146
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:48,371
Sing.

1146
01:26:49,305 --> 01:27:49,310
