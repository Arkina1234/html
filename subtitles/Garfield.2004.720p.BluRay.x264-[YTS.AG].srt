00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,217
What the... Aw.

00:01:57,255 --> 00:02:00,281
Oh...

[Groans]

7
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:10,460
I hate Mondays.

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,677
Pooky, cover me.
I'm goin' in.

Alley... oop.!

B-b-b-b-b-bah, ha!

[Singsong]
Oh, Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

13
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,720
You can stop dreaming about me
because I'm here.

14
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:43,530
Now, just wake up.
You've got work to do.

15
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:47,435
You're not just my owner,
you're my primary caregiver.

16
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:49,564
- Now be a...
- Not now, Garfield.

17
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:51,575
Get... A-Ah...
Just... All right.

18
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:54,043
Cut the sweet stuff.
Easy now. Just...

19
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,272
Trying to cuddle
with me, huh?

20
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,786
Trying to avoid
your duties, huh?

21
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:05,550
Well, that just
ain't gonna... fly!

22
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:08,854
It isn't gonna
work with m... me.

23
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,725
See, I'm getting my exercise,
doin' my job.

24
00:03:11,796 --> 00:03:14,162
Just one quick cannonball!

25
00:03:14,232 --> 00:03:15,597
- Oh!
- Morning.

Okay! I think you're clean enough now.

29
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,934
- H-H-Hot.! Hot.! Hot.!
- Got your towel right here.

00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,740

[Beeps]

32
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:43,392
- It's liver flavored.
- Mm! Delicious.

00:03:43,461 --> 00:03:45,395
[Gags]

34
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,456
Mm. Mm!

Mm!

Oh! Oh, liver!

- [Spitting]
- Well, actually, it's liver flavored.

38
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,244
[Sighs]
That was a good breakfast.

39
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:04,008
Now I think I'll just
fall off the "Catkin's" diet...

40
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:06,482
and get myself
a little high-fat chaser.

41
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,712
Mmm.

42
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:11,550
- Garfield, look, the milk truck.
- Oh, attaboy, Nermal.

43
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:14,956
- The milk truck comes every day.
- Yeah, but maybe not today.

44
00:04:15,026 --> 00:04:18,587
Maybe it's changing routes.
Maybe this'll be the last we'll ever see of it.

45
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,063
Come on. It's just across the street.
We're cats. We like milk.

46
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,656
- Let's go for it.
- No.

47
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,065
- But, you... - 
- But nothin'.

48
00:04:24,135 --> 00:04:26,899
I don't leave
the cul-de-sac for anything.

49
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:29,496
Out there,
it's a hornet's nest of trouble.

50
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:33,704
Bad things happen out there.
So I don't go out there.

51
00:04:33,778 --> 00:04:36,679
Besides, I've found
if you wait long enough...

52
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:40,149
everything comes to you.

55
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:48,459
let's play astronaut
again today.

56
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:50,756
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I love that game.

57
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:52,762
You're such a brave
little astronaut.

58
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,459
- All right.
- Prepare tojump into your spaceship,
Commander Nermal.

59
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,468
But wh-wh-what
about the milk?

60
00:04:58,536 --> 00:05:00,401
- Who needs milk when you can be in outer space?
- Ah.

61
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:03,099
- You got a secret mission today.
- Yeah?

62
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,142
- You'll be exploring the Milky Way.
- Okay.

63
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,838
I get the chills when you jump
in your little spacecraft.

64
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,938
The nation thanks you.
Prepare to blast off.

65
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:13,210
- I'm ready to go, friend.
- Three, two, one.

66
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,377
Whoa!
Now I feel like it.

67
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,148
Bon voyage.

68
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:19,052
Look at me go.!
Whoo-hoo.!

69
00:05:19,123 --> 00:05:21,114
- [Garfield] Don't look down.!
- I'm an eagle flying.!

[Garfield]
Come to papa, baby.

71
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:26,496
I can see everything up here.
I can see my house.

72
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:28,657
[Burps]
Got milk?

73
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,361
I can see
the whole neighborhood.

74
00:05:31,436 --> 00:05:34,303
- Well, that's nice. That's very nice.
- Hey, there's another milk truck.

75
00:05:34,372 --> 00:05:37,808
Ooh.!
And that is even nicer.

76
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:40,309
- I can see... Whoa!
- Mission accomplished, Nermal.

77
00:05:40,378 --> 00:05:42,846
Whoa.! Whoa,
Garfield, do it again.

78
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,848
Where did everybody go?

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,477
You're on the wrong side
of the street, fat cat. Beat it!

80
00:05:48,553 --> 00:05:51,078
And you, Luca, the wrong side
of the evolutionary curve.

81
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,248
Okay, that's it.

82
00:05:53,324 --> 00:05:56,919
- You're gonna get it good today.
- I make a point to get it good every day.

83
00:05:56,995 --> 00:05:59,930
The real question, Luca,
is how shall I outwit you this time?

84
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,694
- What?
- Shall I baffle you with simple math?

85
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:06,032
- I know how to spell.
- Or should I distract you with something shiny?

86
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,868
- Now you're making fun of me.
- I hope so. You're no fun to look at.

87
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,101
You'll never get
the best of me! Aaah!

88
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:15,544
- I think I just did.
- Not the ducks again!

89
00:06:15,613 --> 00:06:19,071
Jump back!
And kiss myself.

90
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,278
Oooh!

91
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:25,618
If I ever get off this chain,
you're goin' down.

92
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,524
Everybody back up! I don't know
how wild this thing is gonna get.

93
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,722
I love the smell of
cinnamon-apple in the morning.

94
00:06:32,797 --> 00:06:35,163
[Sniffs]
It smells like... victory.

95
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,895
[Luca] Oooh!
I hate this fat cat.

96
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:45,200
So much time,
and so little I need to do.

97

No thanks, I'm full.

Oh, it's always gotta be
smashing and crashing.

104
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:11,264
Nobody poisons anymore.

105
00:07:12,336 --> 00:07:14,634
Aha.!

106
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:17,401
Whoa...
[Groans]

107
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,238
There's my ball!

108
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,336
What good is a cat
that can't chase a mouse?

109
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,472
I don't do the chase thing.

110
00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:26,744
All right,
I'll handle this.

111
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,412
I know you don't hear me,
but can't you just listen?

[Panting]

113
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:40,094
Louis, what are you doing
in the house when Jon's home?

114
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,132
Sorry, Garfield, man.
I couldn't help it.

115
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,692
Look, when he sees you, he expects
more from me. Don't you get that?

116
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,534
Jon's got those macadamia nut cookies.
I'm trying to maintain.

117
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,632
- You understand?
- Sure. As long as you understand I have to eat you.

118
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,734
Aw!

- Mm! Mmm!
- Oh, good boy.

123
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:10,187
See, I knew you could do it
if you put your mind to it.

124
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:13,321
- You are the best cat a guy could have.

Have you tasted
yourself lately?

128
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,908
Hey, it wasn't exactly the first-class lounge
in there for me either.

129
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:31,039
Get yourself lost. Take a powder for a couple days,
get a haircut and grow a beard.

Cool.
I owe you one, "G."

131

I got a question for you.
Do you love your cat?

132
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:39,582
Finally, back on
my regular schedule.

133
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:42,558
You're gonna make sure
he has nothing but Kibbly Kat food.

134
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,561
Isn't that right,
Persnikitty?

135
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:49,066
That cat's puss is everywhere...
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.

136
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,966
Who would want
that kind of exposure?

Remember, be happy.

of tomato paste, ricotta cheese,
ground meat and pasta!

142

Garfield, don't even
think about it.

143
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:11,449
That's my food.

144
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:13,456
I may just nibble.

from the network yet?

Uh, no, but they're looking for a dog act
on Good Day, New York.

157
00:09:49,393 --> 00:09:52,021
Dog act!
Story of my life.

158
00:09:52,096 --> 00:09:54,621
Looking for a dog,
and I'm stuck with a cat.

159
00:09:54,699 --> 00:09:56,633
I thought the segment
went quite well.

160
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:58,692
[Whiny Voice]
"I thought the segment went quite well."

161
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,703
Of course it went well,
you toad!

162
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:03,604
The 50 housewives
who saw it, loved it.

163
00:10:03,674 --> 00:10:07,633
This is WalterJ. Chapman
reporting live from The Hague.

164
00:10:07,712 --> 00:10:10,010
Oh, please,
what a know-it-all!

165
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,742
...were met with angry crowds...

166
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:15,274
And everybody always said
I was the handsome one.

167
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,811
I was the smart one.
And I was born first.

168
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:21,824
But there you are
"live from The Hague"...

169
00:10:21,892 --> 00:10:26,090
and here I am working with this sack of dander
on a dead-end regional morning show.

170
00:10:26,163 --> 00:10:27,555
Back to you, Dan.

171
00:10:27,565 --> 00:10:28,532
Back to you, Dan.

172
00:10:31,102 --> 00:10:33,036
Garfield!

173
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:36,039
- [Moaning]
- Did you eat all four boxes of lasagna?

174
00:10:36,107 --> 00:10:38,940
[Hiccups]
It's not my fault. They started it.

175
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,875
What am I gonna do
with you?

176
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:43,743
Love me. Feed me.
Never leave me.

177
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:46,214
Come on. Let's go for a ride
to someplace you love...

178
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:49,048
that always leaves you
feeling pampered and refreshed.

179
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,021
Huh? Oh, I know...
Chuck E. Cheese.

180
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,523
[Garfield]
Thank you.

181
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:58,892
No? Wendy's?
Taco Kitty? No?

182
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:02,990
Well, I'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden for you?

183
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:08,767
Hmm. The only time I ever leave my cul-de-sac
is when Jon takes me to the vet...

184
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,742
which he's been doing a lot recently,
and it appears to have nothing to do with me.

185
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:17,440
Jon must want to go
for his own reason.

186
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:20,075
Well, there's nothing wrong
with Garfield.

187
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:22,312
He's just a happy,
fat, lazy cat.

188
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,320
No need for
a second opinion.

189
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:26,515
- Well, I worry about him.
- I know you do.

190
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,683
Ooh!
[Giggles]

191
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,660
You know, you care about him more than
any owner I've ever known.

192
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:34,698
"Him" has a name.
Is this an H.M.O.?

193
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:38,496
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
I wanna talk to you in private.

194
00:11:40,237 --> 00:11:43,729
- Mm. Oh!
- She's so beautiful.

195
00:11:43,808 --> 00:11:46,675
Uh, Mr. Pathetic, you've had a crush
on her since high school.

196
00:11:46,744 --> 00:11:51,010
Would you please ask her out so she can
reject you, and we can get on with my life?

197
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,607
- I have to ask her out.
- [Groans]

198
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:56,244
- Wish me luck.
- Okay, go get 'em, big tiger.

199
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,845
You the man. You the fella.
You the boss.

200
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,915
You preach to her. Show her how
the cow eats the cabbage...

201
00:12:01,992 --> 00:12:04,552
you hopeless loser.

202
00:12:06,697 --> 00:12:09,996
Betty, today, why don't you start me off
with a Swedish massage...

203
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:12,262
a manicure
and a pedicure, okay?

204
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:14,566
Seaweed wrap, loofah...

205
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,572
belly rub, uh...

206
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,473
tail waxing and then
crack my toes to finish.

207
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:23,274
Jon, there's something
important I need to ask you.

208
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:26,043
Something that I wouldn't ask
most guys who come in here.

209
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:28,984
Wait, no. I think I know
where this is going.

210
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,987
- You do?
- I do.

211
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:34,218
Liz, I've wanted to ask you
the same thing for a very long time.

212
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,919
- Are you sure that
we're talking about the same thing?
- Absolutely.

213
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:39,895
Yeah, uh, I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

214
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:42,558
Liz, I am ready
to take a chance.

215
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,158
- I am ready for...
- [Yips]

216
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,397
[Laughs]
Thank you.

217
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,167
- A dog!
- [Laughs]

218
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,607
A dog.
I'm ready for a dog.

219
00:12:52,676 --> 00:12:54,610
- [Laughs]
- Hi.

220
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,703
- Hey, I think he likes you.
- Hi. Yeah.

221
00:12:56,781 --> 00:12:58,874
- [Whines]
- Hi.

222
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:01,918
[Chuckles] He's a frisky... frisky
little fella, isn't he?

223
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:04,284
His name's Odie,
and he's not gonna make it...

224
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:06,721
if he has to live
his life in a cage.

225
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,817
He needs to
be loved.

226
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,624
[Hair Dryer Blowing]

227
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:20,868
Well, thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:23,600
- No, maybe not in my neighborhood.
- [Whining]

229
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:27,633
Hey, Boomer,
I really gotta run.

230
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:31,943
Gotta fly, everybody. Really, please,
stay behind the security fences.

231
00:13:32,016 --> 00:13:34,177
So great of you
to come out to see me...

232
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:37,220
but I've got somebody waiting for me,
very devoted, almost crippled.

233
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:39,222
- [Meowing]
- No, please, don't cry.

234
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,158
I know what it's like to be unloved.
Well, you do.

235
00:13:43,227 --> 00:13:46,355
I'll try to come back and visit,
and if I don't, I'll try to write.

236
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,660
- Bye-bye.
- Does anybody know this guy?

237
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:51,326
Bye-bye, everybody.
Garfield is leaving the building.

238
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,802
Jon, you know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

239
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:56,362
No. No, it's okay.

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,965
Some part of me always wanted
to know what it'd be like...

241
00:13:59,043 --> 00:14:01,568
to have a pet that actually
wants to play with you.

242
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,579
[Laughs]
You're a good friend.

243
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:06,343
One question... Am I still gorgeous?
[Gasps]

244
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,916
Jon, I think we got
a little problem here.

245
00:14:09,987 --> 00:14:11,978
- [Whining]
- Uh, Jon...

246
00:14:12,056 --> 00:14:14,217
I can help
the transition go smoothly.

247
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,691
[Garfield]
Jon, it's in my seat. Jon.!

248
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,695
- We could all go out together. Park, dog shows,
- Jon.! Uh, Jon?

249
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:22,288
- stuff like that.
- Uh, Jonny boy?

250
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,891
W-Wait a minute.
Are... Are you... asking me out?

251
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:30,835
Oh, Jonny boy, the time has come
to get a car alarm.

252
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:34,241
You're not gonna believe it. A mongrel mutt
has broken into your car!

253
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:37,041
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

254
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,572
Whoa! You went in there to get a date
and came out with a dog?

255
00:14:40,651 --> 00:14:44,052
Oh, that's bad even for you.
Oh, you're so sad!

256
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:47,852
Oh, no, no, no. We're not
bringing a dog home with us.

257
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,893
Hey, I ride shotgun!

258
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:53,425
What are you looking at, tick boy?

259
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,566
[Garfield]
Jon, it's not too late.

260
00:14:56,634 --> 00:15:00,502
Quickly, turn around...
before he finds out where we live.!

261
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:03,165
[Crying]

262
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,403
Please take this
trouser sniffer back.!

263
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,604
- Please.
- Come on, Odie. Let's go.

264
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:11,512
This is your new home.

265
00:15:11,582 --> 00:15:14,574
[Crying]

266
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,952
Come on, buddy.

267
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:23,153
Jon, you had me,
a chick magnet...

268
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:26,594
and now you've got
a tick magnet.

269
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,757
[Sniffling]

270
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:31,096
Garfield,
Jon brought a dog home.

271
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:34,399
- I am aware, Nermal.
- Why would he do a thing like that?

272
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:36,517
Gee, I don't know, Nermal.

273
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,812
It just seems like
a weird thing to do...

274
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:41,753
bringing a dog into a house
that already has a cat.

275
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:44,347
Can we drop it?
I mean, it's no big... deal.

276
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:47,394
It's... just a splattered bug
on the windshield of my life.

277
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:49,429
A bug?

278
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,658
A dim-witted, smelly, goofy...
[Sighs]

279
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:55,361
splattered bug that I will deal with
appropriately and enthusiastically.

280
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,633
- Come on.
- As you can see, I'm stillJon's favorite.

281
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,607
See ya later, Garfield.
Good luck with the bug thing!

282
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:03,667
Come on.

283
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:08,607
[Laughs] This is payback
for the liver thing, isn't it?

284
00:16:08,683 --> 00:16:11,811
Payback.
[Laughs] He's a nut.

285
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:16,186
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.

286
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:18,418
And, uh, the TV over there.

287
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:20,790
- And, uh, the kitchen.
- Hm.

288
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,489
You wanna go see it?
Okay, go see the house. Go see it.

289
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:26,465
Why don't you draw him
a map?

290
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:30,766
Okay, I've gotta...
remain calm, that's all.

291
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:32,931
Jon's a cat guy,
not a dog guy.

292
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,999
This'll last a week,
maybe 10 days. Tops.

293
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:40,013
Boy, this puppy
is stupid gone wild!

294
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:44,313
Nah, this is just a bad dream. I'm gonna
close my eyes and when I open them...

295
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:46,615
everything will be
back to normal.

296
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,654
- [Panting]
- Ah! That's not normal.

297
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,664
Not close.
Oh, great.

298
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,326
Dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.

299
00:17:03,004 --> 00:17:05,234
- [Thuds]
- [Shudders]

300
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:07,240
This is a nightmare. l...

301
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:11,176
I just need a little quality time
with man's real best friend...

302
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,145
television.

303
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:16,783
[Chuckles]

304
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:21,550
[Sputters]
No, no, no. No, no. No.

305
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:24,682
Hey, new guy, let me hip you
to the rules, okay?

306
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:27,159
Number one...
that's my chair, all right?

307
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:32,461
I even see you raise a leg,
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

308
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:37,003
Very well.

309
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:39,232
- [Smack]
- [Whines]

310
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:53,710
Yeah, I think I just may have
a mental advantage on this guy.

311
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,661
Leave me alone.
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

312
00:18:09,737 --> 00:18:13,434
Pop a worm pill
and hit the road. I'm busy.

313
00:18:13,507 --> 00:18:17,534
You wanna play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.

314
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,842
Go jump in the pail,
and we'll shoot you into outer space.

315
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:24,373
Come on. It's real simple.
Here, I'll even throw your ball in there.

316
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,784
Follow the ball,
andjump in the pail.

317
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,049
Come on, Odie.
Just like this.

318
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:33,025
Come on over here and just jump
right into the pail, and help me.

319
00:18:33,094 --> 00:18:35,255
Come on. No.
Just in here like this.

320
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,853
Uh-oh.!
Don't touch that.!

321
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:39,456
Aaah!

322
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:44,061
Oh, no.!

323
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:47,070
Whoa!

324
00:18:51,045 --> 00:18:52,842
Aaah.!

325
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,819
Oh, no!

326
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:07,091
Houston, we have a problem.

327
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:10,153
Odie, get off the pail.

328
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:12,927
Would you get off
the pail, please?

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,298
Okay, time for a new game.

330
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,394
It's called
"my claw in your butt"game.

331
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:20,065
Come here! Get back here!

332
00:19:20,141 --> 00:19:22,837
Come on!
I'll just use my left claw.

333
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,073
If my legs were longer,
I'd have caught you by now. Come here.

334
00:19:26,147 --> 00:19:28,581
Just wait for one second.

335
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:29,775
Slow... down.

336
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,182
- [Laughs]
- Ahhh... - 

337
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,620
Well, well, well.
I've got you now, fat cat.

338
00:19:35,689 --> 00:19:39,250
Hey, Luca, is that a new chain
you're wearin', fella?

339
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:41,817
Looks good on ya. You look great.
You been working out?

340
00:19:41,896 --> 00:19:44,865
Oh, I've been waiting
years for this.

341
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:47,196
- Would that be regular years or dog years?
- [Growls]

342

- [Cowering]
- [Barks]

343
00:19:49,904 --> 00:19:52,805
What the... Get away
from me, pip-squeak.

344
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:56,832
Uh, Luca, this is Odie.
Odie, Luca.

345
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:59,175
Luca, do me a favor and eat him for me,
would you, please?

346
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,680
- [Girl Cat] Garfield, are you all right?
- I think so.

347
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,047
Luca's about
to have Odie for lunch.

348
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:06,643
If it wasn't for Odie,
you'd be Luca's chew toy.

349
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,120
[Nermal]
Yeah, he saved your life.

350
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,717
- Odie's a hero!
- Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?

351
00:20:12,793 --> 00:20:15,626
No, Odie's an imbecile
until further notice.

352
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:18,426
[Jon Gurgling]

353
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,433
Hey, moondust...

354
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:23,163
if I were you, I'd grab
a nice piece of carpet.

355
00:20:23,237 --> 00:20:25,728
Jon doesn't let me
sleep up top. Ever.

356
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:28,240
[Sighs]

357
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,039
Odie... You wanna
sleep in the bed?

358
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,045
Okay.

359
00:20:33,113 --> 00:20:36,014
Wha...

360
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,484
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?

361
00:20:39,553 --> 00:20:41,487
You want to sleep
on the bed tonight?

362
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,489
[Jon In High Voice]
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

363
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:47,152
I think I'm going
to blow cat-chow chunks.

364
00:20:47,228 --> 00:20:49,219
Good night, Odie.
Good night, Garfield.

365
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:51,321
Great. Wish me luck
with the nightmares.

366
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,682
Another day ruined.

367
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:22,521
Oh, you little suck-up. Oh!

368
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:26,259
## [Singing]

369
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,802
Whoa! Whoa, baby.

370
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:37,372
No. Down.
Down, dumb dog.

371
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,213
What part of"no"
don't you understand?

372
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:50,155
The push off the chair?
Off! I don't want to play.

373
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:53,785
Oh! Look. What am I
supposed to say?

374
00:21:53,861 --> 00:21:56,523
"Thanks for saving
my hide with Luca?"

375
00:21:56,597 --> 00:21:59,259
Okay, thanks for saving
my hide with Luca. Get off!

376
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:02,397
Where was I? Right here.
I was right here.

377
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:04,835
Oh!
[Groans]

378
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:06,839
That was a cheap shot.

379
00:22:06,907 --> 00:22:09,774
Hit a guy
when he's not looking? Okay.

380
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:12,676
Oh, excuse me. l-I think you
may have forgotten something.

381
00:22:12,746 --> 00:22:15,647
I saw this and I thought,
pretty sure it was your...

382
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:18,947
Oh, I love to dish it out.
[Laughs]

383
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:22,955
- ##[Continues]
- Watch out. You see, you can't touch this.

384
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,957
Come on.
Uh-huh.

385
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:29,155
That's right.
Don't sneak up on me, baby.

386
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:32,426
Oh, come on with that.

387
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:34,660
Get that weak stuff outta here.

388
00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,669
Is that butt broken?

389
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:38,864
No, it's something
like this here.

390
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:41,533
Can you do this?

391
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:45,374
Uh, shouldn't those hips be in the shop?
Walk this way, please.

392
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,243
I'm-a walking the dog.

393
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,681
Well, step it up a little bit.
Something like this.

394
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,950
Ho, look at this.
Watch out for this thing.

395
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:58,389
It could go. Uh-huh.

396
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:00,484
You probably should've
practiced in the garage...

397
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:03,029
before you stepped up
to someone of my level.

398
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,965
Back up.
Come on.

399
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:08,866
Fly with me. Maybe something
a little bit more challenging.

400
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:12,565
Hey! How 'bout this?
Out the front door.

401
00:23:12,639 --> 00:23:15,540
Take it outside.!

402
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:17,975
Look who's here
on the porch.

403
00:23:18,045 --> 00:23:21,845
I'm walking the porch.
I'm holding a torch. I'm ready to scorch.

404
00:23:21,915 --> 00:23:24,645
Uh-huh.
That's fancy footwork.

405
00:23:24,718 --> 00:23:26,652
Hey! Look. Garfield's
dancing with Odie.

406
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,483
They're like buddies now!

407
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:31,854
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Odie, what are you doing here?

408
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:35,588
I was doing a solo dance,
and a creepy dog comes up next to me?

409
00:23:35,662 --> 00:23:36,620
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.

410
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,325
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.

411
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,867
Uh-oh.
Here's more trouble.

412
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,232
Look at the goony look
on his face.

413
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:52,767
- Come on, buddy. Come here. Come on.
- Taking him back to the vet?

414
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:55,610
- Time for our date with Liz.
- Takin'him back to the kennel, right?

415
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:59,448
Yeah? Are you putting
him up for adoption?

416
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,286
Hey, Garfield,
Jon's taking Odie on his date with Liz...

417
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,554
- and he's leaving you behind.
- I know, Nermal.

418
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:09,255
[Nermal] They're off
on an adventure and you're still here.

419
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:11,263
And your point is?

420
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:13,458
Well, that's gotta feel bad...

421
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:16,264
being left byJon
while he takes Odie out.

422
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:19,100
It's like you're not
his favorite anymore.

423
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:21,539
Hey, what do you say
we play brain surgeon?

424
00:24:21,608 --> 00:24:24,270
Would you go get my power tools?
[Groans]

425
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,413
This is so sad.

426
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,540
Jon has completely
lost his mind.

427
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,744
Doesn't realize
how important I am to him.

428
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,152
I need to be so very
understanding of him...

429
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:37,486
at this difficult time.

430
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:40,994
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!
You forgot me!

431
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:44,428
Slow down! Please slow down!
I'm right back here!

432
00:24:44,498 --> 00:24:48,093
Waa... oh! I think
I pulled a hamstring.

433
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:55,104
All right. It's okay.
I'm on. I'm on. Relax.

434
00:24:58,846 --> 00:25:01,781
Oh, my poor nose.

435
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:02,539
[Man On P.A.] So, if you own Marie,
please come and claim her.

436
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,916
[Man On P.A.] So, if you own Marie,
please come and claim her.

437
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:09,012
Thank you very much.

438
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:14,391
Now, before the show starts, go over
to the snack section on the south lawn...

439
00:25:14,461 --> 00:25:16,622
and get those goodies.

440
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:18,665
We have things there
that we're sure...

441
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:22,259
[Groans]
Yeah, go on ahead. Uh...

442
00:25:22,336 --> 00:25:25,499
I'll catch up with ya.
It's probably just a mild concussion...

443
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:27,665
or... or a skull fracture.

444
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,936
Maybe I'll get a CATscan.

445
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,638
A CAT scan!

446
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:35,045
[Man On P.A.]
I'd like to ask thejudges now...

447
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:38,141
if they would please
take their positions for the viewings.

448
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:40,914
Oh, watch your step there.
[Laughs]

449
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:47,993
[Applause]

450
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:51,292
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dog show.

451
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,299
Well, what if I
compromise a little?

452
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:56,632
How 'bout I do the rolling around
with the yarn ball thing?

453
00:25:56,703 --> 00:26:02,073
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.

454
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:06,977
I won't climb drapes though. That's more

I know you've been sad and lonely since
the divorce, and I've tried to be a friend...

608
00:37:06,592 --> 00:37:08,526
Not for me, you imbecile.
For the act.

609
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:12,928
If I could get my hands on
a really talented dog...

610
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:17,128
wouldn't WalterJ.
just choke on his Emmy?

611
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,831
- Like Odie?
- Yeah.

612
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:23,170
Yeah, now he was good.

613
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,679
Oh, yeah. You know, he was
kinda dopey-looking and spry.

614
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,680
- And...
- Lost!

615
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,773
[Happy]
Hmm?

616
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:40,017
Hi, it's Jon. I was just calling to see
if Odie's been over there.

617
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,890
My name is Jon Arbuckle,
and, um, I can't find my dog.

618
00:37:42,962 --> 00:37:45,795
I've looked all around the neighborhood,
and I can't find him.

619
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:47,730
I saw him last night, but I
haven't seen him this morning.

620
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,394
And, uh, if you see him,
give me a call, please.

621
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:53,905
Uh, I was calling to see if you'd seen Odie?
Um, I think he's run away.

622
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:57,465
I was giving him a bath,
and I forgot to put his collar back on.

623
00:37:57,543 --> 00:37:59,477
You know, 'cause
Garfield hates his collar.

624
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:03,208
He's about 15 pounds.
He's brownish yellow with brown floppy ears.

625
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,910
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Would you mind getting that?

626
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:08,545
Um, I'm offering a reward.

627
00:38:08,621 --> 00:38:11,715
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, and he answers to the name of...

628
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,816
- Hi.
- Hi. [Chuckles]

629
00:38:14,894 --> 00:38:17,920
I'd say the refrigerator
is unguarded.

630
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:19,692
Wh... What are you
doing here?

631
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,858
We're having dinner,
remember?

632
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:24,835
Right! R...
Dinner.

633
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:27,839
Th-The two of us.
Tonight. Of course.

634
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,600
- Shall I come in?
- Yeah!

635
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,440
Yeah.
Come on in.

636
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:38,510
Uh, you know, uh, Liz,
I have a confession.

637
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:41,712
Uh, uh, it's not really a confession.
More of an admission.

638
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:44,119
It's a... You know what it is?
It's like a, uh...

639
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,350
It's like a declaration.
I have a... a... d...

640
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,757
I love it
when you do that.

641
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,057
- Do what?
- You know, trip over yourself.

642
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,064
It's cute.

643
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:56,761
It's one of the reasons I had
a crush on you in high school.

644
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,769
You had a crush on me?

645
00:38:58,837 --> 00:39:02,000
Yeah. I thought you were
really cute, decent.

646
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:04,304
Not like all those
other jerks.

647
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:06,810
I don't believe it. l...
I had a crush on you too.

648
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:09,370
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah.

649
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:11,382
Hilarious.

650
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:16,888
So, um, what's your confession/
admission/declaration?

651
00:39:16,956 --> 00:39:19,925
Actually, um...

652
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:24,589
I forgot about our dinner.
[Chuckles] Yeah.

653
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,655
[Laughs] Oh, that's okay.
You know, I can... I can go.

654
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:30,327
No. No, I'm...
I'm glad you're here.

655
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:33,394
Let me just, uh, get my jacket,
and then we'll go.

656
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,409
Okay, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

657
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,678
What... What am I gonna do?
I've waited for this night my entire life.

658
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:48,413
If you tell her the truth,
you'll feel much better.

659
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,081
And you won't have to
see her anymore.

660
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:53,750
It's kinda creepy having a vet
around the house anyway.

661
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:56,351
I can't just go out and pretend like
nothing's happened, can I?

662
00:39:56,428 --> 00:40:00,023
Well, I sure could. The one thing you can't do
is tell her the dog's gone.

663
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,068
- I gotta tell her.
- No.

664
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,968
- I've gotta tell her.
- No. That's not what I said.

665
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,438
Schmuck.

666
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,476
Liz, uh,
we can't go out tonight.

667
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,137
- Why not?
- Odie's run away.

668
00:40:14,213 --> 00:40:16,977
- What?
- He got out last night. I feel terrible.

669
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,983
I called the pound.
I put up posters.

670
00:40:19,051 --> 00:40:21,042
I looked everywhere,
but I can't find him.

671
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,748
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I guess I figured...

672
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:26,518
he was the only reason you were
spending time with me.

673
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:30,119
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious. I mean, I thought...

674
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,663
No, I mean, come on.
Let's go find him.

675
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,665
O-Oh.

676
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,738
Ayayayayay.

677
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:46,904
How can this dog be such a problem
when he's not even here anymore?

678
00:40:46,979 --> 00:40:49,140
Well, I'm not gonna
worry about him.

679
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,512
I believe you've
found my dog.

680
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,711
- He answers to "Odie."
- "Odie"?

681
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:56,584
Family name.

682
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:01,148
Oh! Odie!
Oh, come on.

683
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:04,320
There you are. Oh!

684
00:41:04,396 --> 00:41:08,526
[Laughs]
Yes. Yes.

685
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,333
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I can live again now.

686
00:41:13,405 --> 00:41:15,339
How could I ever
repay you?

687
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:17,671
An autograph
would be splendid.

688
00:41:17,743 --> 00:41:19,836
Then splendid
it shall be.

689
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:23,707
- ## [TVTheme]
- [Garfield] Hm.

690
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:26,046
- Uh, no.
- [Man] Come on, boy.

691
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:27,449
[Groans]

692
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:29,043
- [Doorbell Rings]
- [Barks]

693
00:41:29,121 --> 00:41:32,522
[Sighs]
Hmm...

694
00:41:32,591 --> 00:41:35,890
Ooh.

695
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:38,896
This is ridiculous.

696
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:42,365
- Hey, what are you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. Just lookin' for some company.

697
00:41:42,434 --> 00:41:44,026
[Nermal]
Keep walking, creepo.

698
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:46,936
- What's going on?
- We know how much you hated Odie.

699
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:49,405
- We know how much you wanted him gone.
- Wait a minute.

700
00:41:49,475 --> 00:41:51,272
All I wanted was
to sleep in my own bed.

701
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:54,244
And to do it, you cast Odie out
into the cold, cruel world?

702
00:41:54,313 --> 00:41:56,543
We saw how you locked
Odie outside last night.

703
00:41:56,615 --> 00:42:00,449
Oh, I don't believe you guys.
I didn't know he was gonna run away.

704
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,817
He's a dumb dog.
No offense, Luca.

705
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:05,083
- Uh, what?
- You can't blame me for that.

706
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:07,751
- Any one of us could be next.
- Yeah.

707
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,920
There's no room for anybody else
in Garfield's world.

708
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,055
Huh? Oh, that's
a little dramatic.

709
00:42:13,132 --> 00:42:17,068
Well, I may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf...

710
00:42:17,136 --> 00:42:21,266
but, uh,
I don't hate the guy.

711
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:23,534
I understand Happy
has a big surprise for us.

712
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,804
A special treat.
What have you got for us, Hap?

713
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,812
Ah, guten Morgen, Chris.

714
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,407
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have been working
with a very special new friend...

715
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:35,351
and I would like
to introduce him to all of you.

716
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,651
Odieschnitzel!

717
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:43,189
Lookee here!
It's Odie!

718
00:42:43,262 --> 00:42:45,196
And he's safe and sound.

719
00:42:45,264 --> 00:42:48,961
Although, he seems to have found
an alternative lifestyle.

720
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,968
He still can't dance.

721
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,970
Well, this gets me off the hook
with Jon and the gang.

722
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:56,405
- Now I'm gonna be the hero.
- [Mello] That's one talented dog.

723
00:42:56,475 --> 00:43:01,208
Oh, I'm glad you think so, Chris,
because I have a little announcement to make.

724
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,373
Old Happy Chapman
and Odieschnitzel...

725
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:07,043
are going to be climbing aboard
that New Amsterdam Limited at 3:00 p. m...

726
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,883
bound to New York City,
where we have the opportunity...

727
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:13,516
to be regular contributors
on Good Day, New York.

728
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,527
Huh? That's his last name...
Schnitzel?

729
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:19,792
Thank you for all your help yesterday.
You were... You were great.

730
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:22,834
Jon, Odie's on TV,
and he's wearing lederhosen.

731
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,233
l-I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.

732
00:43:25,304 --> 00:43:28,364
Um, I upped the reward
to, um, $200.

733
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,374
And, uh, I'm going to put up
some more posters tomorrow.

734
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,637
He's clog dancing, I think,
wearing lederhosen.

735
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:35,737
I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.

736
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:38,374
- Oh, you're gonna miss it.
- I'm sorry, Liz. I'll call you later.

737
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,680
Garfield's
being... Garfield.

738
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:43,016
Do I have to bark
like Lassie?

739
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:45,056
Come on.
Humor me, would ya?

740
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,614
Arf! Arf! Arf!
Quickly!

741
00:43:47,693 --> 00:43:50,491
While we're young.
Today! Let's go!

742
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:52,587
[Both]
Be happy.

743
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:56,156
Oh, you're gonna miss this. He's the small one.
The small one in the guy's hand.

744
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:58,396
[Garfield Groans]

745
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,371
Garfield, I'm not in the mood.

746
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:06,272
You know, it's never good
when you turn off my TV.

747
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:08,711
And this may be
the worst ever.

748
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,714
[Wendell]
Odie's not ready.

749
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:14,582
H-He's months of positive reinforcement
away from consistently performing.

750
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,852
Happy, you promised
you'd never use that.

751
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,726
I mean, that collar
is inhumane.

752
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:28,823
This collar...

753
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:32,337
is the dog's future.

754
00:44:32,404 --> 00:44:35,396
Do you have a problem
with that?

755
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:37,669
- No.
- No.

756
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:41,304
Now we'll see how smart
you really are.

757
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:47,742
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman.
Happy Chapman.

758
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,151
Not now, Garfield.

759
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:52,690
Jon, you're denser
than ever.

760
00:44:52,758 --> 00:44:55,158
- [Door Opens]
- I gotta think outside the box here.

761
00:44:55,227 --> 00:44:57,821
- [Door Closes]
- Hey, the box!

762
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,830
Wait a second.

763
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:05,366
My box... My box
had something on it.

764
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:08,065
Let's see. AppleJacks.
Frosted Flakes. Cocoa Puffs.

765
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,667
Kibbly Kat.
Yes, there it is.

766
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:16,703
Telegraph Tower. That's where they make
The Happy Chapman Show.

767
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:19,649
Yeah. But how far away
can that be?

768
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,482
Maybe...
Hmm, a paw?

769
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:26,456
Apaw and a half maybe.
This is a done deal. I can do this.

770
00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:29,619
[Panting]
No!

771
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:33,654
Can't do this.
Reached physical limits.

772
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:36,030
Shouldn't have tried it
without snacks.

773
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,036
Must go back and reload.

774
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:42,335
- [Applause]
- Jenny, how are you? Welcome to the show.

775
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:45,469
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

776
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:48,299
- [Applause]
- Mmm. Mmm.

777
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:51,273
Mmm.
[Burps]

778
00:45:51,342 --> 00:45:54,038
Ah, and that's the sign
that the tank is full.

779
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:58,205
I can do this. Beyond this intersection
is just another intersection.

780
00:45:58,282 --> 00:46:00,546
And another and another.

781
00:46:00,618 --> 00:46:04,054
On the other hand, I wonder if there's
any meat loafleft in the fridge.

782
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:06,589
No. Now's not the time
for a plate of meat loaf.

783
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:08,625
Now's the time
for a plate of courage.

784
00:46:08,692 --> 00:46:14,130
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.

785
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:26,139
#He is trampling out
the vintage where the grapes
of wrath are stored #

786
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,838
- # He has... ##
- [Honking]

787
00:46:30,547 --> 00:46:33,675
[Garfield]
Now that's more my style.

788
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,514
Oh, taxi.

789
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,918
[Garfield]
Step on it, will you, driver?

790
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:48,125
No, Odie's not a hound dog.
Yes, I'm sure.

791
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:50,928
No, I don't want
another dog.

792
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:52,935
- Thanks anyway.
- [Phone Beeps]

793
00:46:53,003 --> 00:46:55,528
Garfield, lunchtime.

794
00:46:56,807 --> 00:46:59,435
I made your favorite...
lasagna.

795
00:47:03,714 --> 00:47:05,648
Garfield!

796
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,784
Garfield!

797
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:11,787
Garfield, where are you?

798
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,590
Can anyone direct me
to the pink building...

799
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:22,063
that's shown on the back
of the Kibbly Kat box?

800
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:26,228
Uh, it's the one right by
the blue-and-orange tree.

801
00:47:27,371 --> 00:47:30,704
Well, this doesn't feel
pink building-ish.

802
00:47:31,809 --> 00:47:33,299
[Clattering]

803
00:47:33,377 --> 00:47:36,005
- Hello?
- Now where you going? Oh, what is that?

804
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,173
- [Garfield] Uh-oh, rats.
- [Rat] Come on! Come on!

805
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,307
- Rats the size of rats.
- Come on, kids.

806
00:47:40,384 --> 00:47:42,318
Is that big orange blob a cat?

807
00:47:42,386 --> 00:47:44,877
Hey, now, why am I
being surrounded here?

808
00:47:44,955 --> 00:47:47,822
- Some of my best friends are vermin.
- [Rats Chattering]

809
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:49,688
- Finally, some meat.
- [Cheering]

810
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,388
Meat? No, it's not meat.
I'm... They measured.

811
00:47:52,463 --> 00:47:55,557
It's 100% body fat.
No nutritional value whatsoever.

812
00:47:55,632 --> 00:47:57,395
Hey, body fat's
good with us.

813
00:47:57,468 --> 00:47:59,527
- [Rats] Mmm. Yea.! Yippee.!
- Uh... Uh... Louis.

814
00:47:59,603 --> 00:48:02,868
- Garfield.! Coming through.
Hey, what's going on here?
- Oh, it's my friend.

815
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,875
Come on, Louis.
I got 3,000 teeny mouths to feed.

816
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:08,411
Hey, back off. Garfield?
What are you doing here?

817
00:48:08,479 --> 00:48:12,108
Besides defending my life?
Jon got a dog...

818
00:48:12,182 --> 00:48:15,049
dog got kidnapped by a TV star,
I'm trying to rescue him.

819
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,212
Seems like you got yourself
in a jam, huh?

820
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,380
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

821
00:48:19,456 --> 00:48:22,391
Louis, I think you and I
have an account still, remember?

822
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:25,553
- The macadamia nut cookies?
- I do love the macadamia.

823
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:28,154
- Sorry, rat pack, this cat's with me.
- Aw, come on.

824
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:30,632
Y'all got to roll.
Go ahead. Roll out.

825
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:34,068
Who wants to go
to the Red Lobster alley?

826
00:48:34,138 --> 00:48:36,902
[Laughs] Hey, maybe next time,
little critters.

827
00:48:36,974 --> 00:48:39,067
Good luck with the plague
and rabies and everything.

828
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:40,940
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

829
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:45,279
Garfield, you can't just
be wandering around the city.

830
00:48:45,349 --> 00:48:47,579
There are dangers everywhere.

831
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:50,245
Potholes, subways,
animal control.

832
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,584
You think you can get me
to Telegraph Tower?

833
00:48:52,656 --> 00:48:56,023
Two more cookies and you got a deal.
But we gotta keep it on the down-low.

834
00:48:56,093 --> 00:48:58,254
[Garfield]
How down low do we have to go?

835
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:00,558
[Louis]
Yo, Garfield, you with me?

836
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:03,566
Louis, this is a little bit
lower than I expected.

837
00:49:03,634 --> 00:49:06,762
If I didn't have a box over my head,
I'd be humiliated.

838
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:11,769
Okay, hold up. All right.
We're almost there.

839
00:49:11,842 --> 00:49:15,505
Now, when I give you the signal,
we gotta cross the street.

840
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:19,345
- [Garfield] Way over there by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield. Let's go.!

841
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:21,316
Wait up.! Wait up.!

842
00:49:22,486 --> 00:49:24,454
[Gasps, Groans]

843
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:26,512
[Grunts]

844
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,185
- Am I dead?
- Garfield, don't move!

845
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,353
Don't move?
Not a problem.

846
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:34,659
[Louis]
Just wait for the walk signal.

847
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:40,268
Oh, no, it's a stampede.!
Stampede.!

848
00:49:40,337 --> 00:49:42,771
- If I can just get away from this herd.
- Garfield!

849
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:46,142
Garfield!

850
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,701
Garfield, where are you?

851
00:49:48,779 --> 00:49:51,145
Garfield, get down
from there, man.

852
00:49:51,215 --> 00:49:53,683
No. I'm not coming down.

853
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,685
I'm happy to live the rest of my life
up here. Thank you.

854
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:04,158
Liz! Liz!

855
00:50:04,228 --> 00:50:07,095
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's gone. I think he's run away too.

856
00:50:07,164 --> 00:50:10,156
First Odie, and now Garfield.
Liz, I am the worst pet owner on the planet.

857
00:50:10,234 --> 00:50:12,395
- Wait. What happened?
- I can't find him. You gotta help me.

858
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:14,403
I can't live
without Garfield.

859
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:16,763
Let's start at the park.

860
00:50:16,773 --> 00:50:17,205
Let's start at the park.

861
00:50:17,274 --> 00:50:20,266
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

862
00:50:20,344 --> 00:50:22,812
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

863
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,405
Garfield, relax.
Look. We're here.

864
00:50:25,482 --> 00:50:27,416
- We're here now.
- Curb service.

865
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:32,182
The Telegraph Tower
in all its splendor.

866
00:50:35,259 --> 00:50:37,784
[Garfield]
It looks much smaller on the box.

867
00:50:37,861 --> 00:50:40,352
You gotta go all the way up there?
Good luck, playa.

868
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,762
I'll catch you later.
I don't do the vertical thing.

869
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,165
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Oh, yeah. Hold up, "G."

870
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:47,795
- What?
- Watch out for the po-po.

871
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:50,738
- You know, five-oh? Control-oh.
- Huh?

872
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:53,537
- Animal control, man.
- Oh, that po-po.

873
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:56,170
- Keep it squeal.
- Hey, thanks, partner.

874
00:50:56,246 --> 00:50:58,680
[Louis]
Oink, oink.

875
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:02,344
I can't try the door. I couldn't
handle another stampede.

876
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:09,717
Hey...

877
00:51:09,793 --> 00:51:12,728
[Panting]

878
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:14,923
First thing Monday morning...
[Breathing Heavily]

879
00:51:14,998 --> 00:51:18,695
I'm gonna get to work
on losing those last 20 pounds.

880
00:51:24,074 --> 00:51:27,532
Okay, everything
looks good out there.

881
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:29,636
Looks like we got ourselves
a blockage.

882
00:51:31,982 --> 00:51:34,246
[Beeping]

883
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:37,786
Hmm.

884
00:51:37,854 --> 00:51:40,914
Guess we'll just...
purge the system.

885
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:47,529
[Straining]

886
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,527
- [Vent Clatters]
- Oh, pardon me.

887
00:51:52,603 --> 00:51:54,833
That wasn't my stomach, was it?

888
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:58,397
- [Air Blowing]
- Ah, there's a cooling breeze.

889
00:51:58,475 --> 00:52:00,636
Ooh. Woah!

890
00:52:00,711 --> 00:52:05,307
Woah.!

891
00:52:09,586 --> 00:52:13,022
- Whee!
- Aaah!

892
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,990
Aaah!

893
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:22,830
Oh, my poor nose.

894
00:52:24,635 --> 00:52:26,569
[Liz]
Jon, stop the car.

895
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:34,735
- What?
- It's Odie.

896
00:52:34,811 --> 00:52:38,008
Somebody found him.
52903 Euclid Street.

897
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:40,447
Let's go.

898
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:41,241
[Garfield]
Odie.!

899
00:52:41,251 --> 00:52:42,843
[Garfield]
Odie.!

900
00:52:42,919 --> 00:52:45,615
Ode.!

901
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:49,050
Ode-ster.!

902
00:52:49,126 --> 00:52:51,492
Ode-man.

903
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:54,462
This rescue thing
is exhausting.

904
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:56,465
When do heroes
get to eat?

905
00:52:56,533 --> 00:52:58,558
- [Barks]
- Oh, my!

906
00:52:58,635 --> 00:53:00,796
- It's Odie.!

00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:05,638
O-O-O-O...

908
00:53:05,709 --> 00:53:09,304
Odie.
I found you.

909
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:11,745
I'm so sorry
I got you into this mess.

910
00:53:11,815 --> 00:53:14,477
Look. We kind of got off
on the wrong paw.

911
00:53:14,551 --> 00:53:17,987
But, come on. You can be
really annoying sometimes.

912
00:53:18,055 --> 00:53:19,886
And you don't give me
enough space.

913
00:53:19,956 --> 00:53:22,516
And you're
a major-league suck-up.

914
00:53:22,592 --> 00:53:26,858
But we have a common purpose.
We shareJon.

915
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:28,955
Jon needs us even more.

916
00:53:29,032 --> 00:53:32,297
And I kinda
want you back home too.

917
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,894
So, stand back.
[Grunting]

918
00:53:34,971 --> 00:53:36,905
I almost got it.

919
00:53:36,973 --> 00:53:41,603
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.

920
00:53:43,647 --> 00:53:45,581
Do you think he's ready
for the audition?

921
00:53:45,649 --> 00:53:49,415
[Happy]
Well, why don't you see for yourself.

922
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:53,388
Come on, Odie.
Showtime.

923
00:53:54,758 --> 00:53:56,783
Now.

924
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,523
Ah. Good morning, New York.

925
00:54:00,597 --> 00:54:04,363
I know you're gonna flip for Odie
because he sure is flipping for you.

Ride 'em, cowboy.

928
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:12,774
- A shock collar? That's... That's inhumane.
- Tomorrow's science today.

929
00:54:12,843 --> 00:54:16,472
Oh, gosh, hot doggy.

930
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:19,037
So, when does
our train leave?

931
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:21,880
Oh. Two hours.

932
00:54:21,952 --> 00:54:24,614
Tickets?
Chop-chop.

933
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:31,723
Poor Odie.
He faces a future of torture...

934
00:54:31,795 --> 00:54:34,263
neglect and degradation.

935
00:54:34,331 --> 00:54:37,664
Hey, nobody gets to mistreat
my dog like that except me.

936
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:46,835
Psst.! I'll be right behind you,
little buddy.

Ah-ooh!

Ah-ooh.!

Woah!
Housekeeping at 12:00!

943
00:55:20,944 --> 00:55:23,174
Woah!
You know...

944
00:55:23,246 --> 00:55:26,272
I think I had a nightmare
like this once.

945
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:29,682
Woah!

946
00:55:40,697 --> 00:55:46,533
Once again, my life has been saved
by the miracle of lasagna.

947
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:50,835
I said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?

948
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:53,967
Odie, here I come!
Don't worry, fella.

949
00:55:54,044 --> 00:55:57,536
- I'll rescue you.!
- [Man] Halt.!

950
00:55:57,614 --> 00:55:59,582
- Gotcha.!
- Woah. Huh?

951
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,981
Well, what have we got here?

952
00:56:02,052 --> 00:56:04,987
Looks like we got us
a cat with no tags.

953
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:07,353
[Garfield] Hey, McGillicuddy,
there's an animal felony...

954
00:56:07,424 --> 00:56:09,551
happening right there
behind you.

955
00:56:09,626 --> 00:56:12,925
I'm trying to do
some rescue work here, pal.

- [Garfield In Carrier] Hey.!

957
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,694
- Welcome to my world, Red.
- [Garfield] I'm gonna call somebody about this.

958
00:56:17,767 --> 00:56:19,997
- Newbie on the block.
- This is police brutality.

959
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:23,836
- Here we go.
- I have tags. I just left them in my other fur.

960
00:56:23,907 --> 00:56:26,102
[Garfield]
This is abusive now. This is abusive.

961
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:28,110
- In you go, big fella.
- [Garfield] Huh?

962
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:32,205
- What is with the cage?
- Okay, lock 'er down.

963
00:56:32,282 --> 00:56:35,809
Oh, now, this is insulting.
You know I'm house-trained.

964
00:56:35,886 --> 00:56:37,820
- Gimme newspaper?
- Settle down, people.

965
00:56:37,888 --> 00:56:40,618
- I oughta give you a bunch of fives.
- Back about your business.

966
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,784
- Rosa, I'm watching you.
- This is all a terrible mistake.

967
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,522
I was trying to save a friend...

968
00:56:46,596 --> 00:56:48,928
that's not very smart,
needed my help.

969
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,467
I don't belong in here.
I have an owner.

970
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:53,628
l-I'm not a stray.

971
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,763
- Hi. I'm Jon Arbuckle.
- Hi.

972
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,774
Um, I think you have
my dog Odie.

973
00:56:58,842 --> 00:57:02,107
- I think you're mistaken.
- No, I saw the flier. Odie's my dog.

974
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:05,204
No, he's Happy Chapman's dog.

975
00:57:05,282 --> 00:57:07,876
Happy Chapman?

976
00:57:07,951 --> 00:57:12,047
The gentleman with the cat
on Channel 37.

977
00:57:12,122 --> 00:57:14,647
He came
and took Odie home.

978
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:18,125
Odie's the family name,
you know?

979
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:21,623
- Well, uh, good day.
- Wait. Wait.

980
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,197
Happy Chapman took Odie?
You think he's got Garfield too?

981
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,501
l-I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

Could you please be quiet?
Guard! Guards!

00:57:48,992 --> 00:57:50,983
Oh, this really
is too much.

989
00:57:51,061 --> 00:57:55,760
Hey, Persnikitty. Happy Chapman's cat.
What are you doing in here?

990
00:57:55,832 --> 00:58:00,701
I was his cat
until I outlived my purpose.

991
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,797
Oh, then he replaced me with a dog
and dumped me in this wretched place.

992
00:58:04,874 --> 00:58:08,275
- All humans are the same.
- Oh, notJon, my owner.

993
00:58:08,345 --> 00:58:11,872
[Chuckles] No way.
He only does what's best for me.

994
00:58:11,948 --> 00:58:14,439
He puts up with me,
and he feeds me.

995
00:58:14,517 --> 00:58:17,452
And he lets you vacation
in this charming animal pound. Hello?

996
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,385
Yeah, not for long,
Persnikitty.

997
00:58:19,456 --> 00:58:21,583
Would you please
just stop calling me that?

998
00:58:21,658 --> 00:58:24,286
My name isn't
really Persnikitty.

999
00:58:24,361 --> 00:58:26,886
- It's Sir Roland.
- Sir Roland?

1000
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:29,864
Yes. Another one of
Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.

1001
00:58:29,933 --> 00:58:32,629
I was trained in the classical theater,
you know. Uh-huh.

1002
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:36,399
But now, I'm a celebrity
cable castoff cat...

1003
00:58:36,473 --> 00:58:38,964
with a name
I can never live down.

1004
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:40,976
Well, this may hurt
a little then.

1005
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:44,207
I'm trying to rescue the dog
that replaced you, Persnikitty.

1006
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,876
I mean, Roland. Uh, Happy and Odie
are getting on a train in less than two hours...

1007
00:58:48,952 --> 00:58:51,420
to go to New York to become regulars
on Good Day, New York.

1008
00:58:51,488 --> 00:58:54,685
Wait a minute.
Did I just hear that right?

1009
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:58,216
You're a cat that's
trying to rescue a dog?

1010
00:58:58,294 --> 00:59:01,354
It's true. I know.
It's a crime against nature.

1011
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:04,889
At first I thought he was a pain,
but he's grown on me...

1012
00:59:04,968 --> 00:59:08,233
like a wart you wanna have removed
until you realize...

1013
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:11,102
it defines you
in some funny way.

1014
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:14,075
Do you know, that is
absolutely charming.

1015
00:59:14,144 --> 00:59:17,011
Let me ask you
a question, chubby.

1016
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,014
What are you talking about?

1017
00:59:19,082 --> 00:59:23,178
How could you understand?
He's my friend.

1018
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:26,120
Oh, my gosh.
How low have I sunk?

1019
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:28,783
Guard, may I have
some shoelaces, please?

1020
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:33,788
[Guard] Well, hello there.
Right on time.

1021
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:36,195
All right. I need a five-count lineup
right now. Let's go.

1022
00:59:36,266 --> 00:59:38,234
- Move, move, move.
- Hey, what's going on?

1023
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:41,270
Adoption. Looks like one of us
is getting out of here.

1024
00:59:41,337 --> 00:59:43,897
So, you're here
to look at a cat.

1025
00:59:43,973 --> 00:59:45,941
All right. Well, let's see
if we can't take care of you.

1026
00:59:46,009 --> 00:59:48,477
- [Persnikitty] Careful.
- Let's go, boys. Let's hurry it up.

1027
00:59:48,545 --> 00:59:50,740
Can I just say
your hands are freezing?

1028
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:55,012
How are you, newbie?
This might be your lucky day.

1029
00:59:55,085 --> 00:59:57,019
Come here.
There you go.

1030
00:59:57,087 --> 00:59:59,578
Oh, you are a heavy one.

1031
00:59:59,656 --> 01:00:02,557
- Excuse me. Muscle weighs more than fat.
- Come on. That's right.

1032
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:05,185
- Come over here.
- Check this.

1033
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:07,889
Hey, what about me?

1034
01:00:07,964 --> 01:00:10,728
All right.
Let's line it up.

1035
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,098
Paws on the white line.
Tails in the air.

1036
01:00:13,169 --> 01:00:17,009
I don't need to be adopted, guys.
My guyJon is coming to get me, I'm sure.

1037
01:00:17,143 --> 01:00:19,611
- That one.
- Really.

1038
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:21,646
She picked me!
She picked me! She did!

1039
01:00:21,714 --> 01:00:24,945
- [Singsong] She picked me. She picked me.
- Not that one.

1040
01:00:25,017 --> 01:00:27,986
That one. The one that looks
like the cat on TV.

1041
01:00:28,053 --> 01:00:30,112
Back it up, Red.
She went with Trigger.

1042
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:32,157
- [Persnikitty] Sorry, love.
- Come here.

1043
01:00:32,224 --> 01:00:34,454
Better luck next time.
Now you be careful.

1044
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:37,394
- There you go.
- That's not... That's sore. Ow!

1045
01:00:37,463 --> 01:00:39,931
Jon's gonna be here
in five minutes anyway.

1046
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:42,760
When I give the signal,
run like a mad cow.

1047
01:00:42,835 --> 01:00:45,065
- What?
- Don't you want to save your friend?

1048
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:47,503
- Do I really have to run?
- Now!

1049
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:50,167
Eat hair ball, Happy Chapman!

01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:38,395
with breaking news
from the Midwest.

1204
01:10:38,463 --> 01:10:41,159
Abby Shields reporting.
Whatcha got for me, Abby?

1205
01:10:41,233 --> 01:10:45,397
Details are sketchy,
but it appears that a deranged man...

1206
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:47,404
may be the cause
of all the trouble here.

1207
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:49,531
A deranged man?
What is this?

1208
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:53,044
In fact, the police are bringing
the suspect out as we speak.

1209
01:10:53,111 --> 01:10:55,511
Aah! Good grief.
It's my idiot brother.

1210
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,549
[Nermal]
Hey, that's Happy Chapman.

1211
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:01,484
He's going for a ride
in the police car.

1212
01:11:01,553 --> 01:11:04,044
But sources tell me
that this incident...

1213
01:11:04,122 --> 01:11:08,252
somehow involved a dog
and a very heroic cat.

1214
01:11:08,326 --> 01:11:11,955
- [Girl Cat] Garfield.!
- [Nermal] Hey, he saved Odie.!

1215
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:14,999
- Now he's a hero.
- Oh, I didn't realize.

1216
01:11:15,067 --> 01:11:17,365
Garfield's on TV.
He's a hero.

1217
01:11:19,905 --> 01:11:22,430
[Nermal]
Garfield.! That's Garfield.

1218
01:11:22,507 --> 01:11:24,805
- Garfield's a hero now.!
- [Garfield] Thanks, everybody.

1219
01:11:24,876 --> 01:11:27,106
- [Nermal] Hero.!
- Well, thanks for saying so. It's nice to hear.

1220
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:30,444
- [Nermal] We're a whole street full of heroes.
- It sounds sincere. Thank you.

1221
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:32,847
- [Nermal] Yeah. Heroes.!
- [Luca] Okay.

1222
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:34,852
[Luca]
I've been waiting years for this.

1223
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:36,945
- [Nermal] Whoa.!
- Come on, pal.

1224
01:11:37,022 --> 01:11:41,049
- [Nermal] Hey, Arlene.
- Wow. It's nice to be recognized by your peers.

1225
01:11:41,126 --> 01:11:45,324
I couldn't have done this
without you. l...

1226
01:11:45,397 --> 01:11:47,456
We...

1227
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:50,228
You're a really
great friend.

1228
01:11:50,302 --> 01:11:54,068
Jon, I wanna be more
than your friend.

1229
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,900
- You do?
- Yeah.

1230
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:03,274
[Garfield]
Where do they find the energy?

1231

Yeah, right!
Hit the floor.

1234
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:33,513
[Chuckles] No, seriously,
you can come up, buddy.

1235
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:36,246
Come on. Come on.
No, seriously. Come on up.

1236
01:12:38,122 --> 01:12:40,886
Down you go. We just
hit it off so great...

1237
01:12:40,958 --> 01:12:43,722
because we both love
the same thing, and that is...

1238

Hey, Odie, help me.
I can't get up.

Odie, my friend,
