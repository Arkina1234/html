1
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,760

2
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,703
- Huh?

3
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,109
What the... Aw.

4
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,173
Oh...

5
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,476

6
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,352
I hate Mondays.

7
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,895

8
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,569
Pooky, cover me.
I'm goin' in.

9
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,442
Alley... oop!

10
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,947
B-b-b-b-b-bah, ha!

11
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:32,474
Oh, Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

12
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,612
You can stop dreaming about me
because I'm here.

13
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:40,421
Now, just wake up.
You've got work to do.

14
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,327
You're not just my owner,
you're my primary caregiver.

15
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,456
- Now be a...
- Not now, Garfield.

16
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,467
Get... A-Ah...
Just... All right.

17
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,935
Cut the sweet stuff.
Easy now. Just...

18
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,164
Trying to cuddle
with me, huh?

19
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:59,678
Trying to avoid
your duties, huh?

20
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,442
Well, that just
ain't gonna... fly!

21
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,746
It isn't gonna
work with m... me.

22
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,616
See, I'm getting my exercise,
doin' my job.

23
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,054
Just one quick cannonball!

24
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,489
- Oh!
- Morning.

25
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:13,958
Garfield!

26
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,393

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,366
Okay! I think you're clean enough now.

28
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,825
- H-H-Hot! Hot! Hot!
- Got your towel right here.

29
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,632
Garfield! No!

30
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,310

31
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,284
- It's liver flavored.
- Mm! Delicious.

32
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,287

33
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,348
Mm. Mm!

34
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,416
Mm!

35
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,895
Oh! Oh, liver!

36
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:56,129
- Well, actually, it's liver flavored.

37
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,136
That was a good breakfast.

38
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,900
Now I think I'll just
fall off the "Catkin's" diet...

39
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,374
and get myself
a little high-fat chaser.

40
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,604
Mmm.

41
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,442
- Garfield, look, the milk truck.
- Oh, attaboy, Nermal.

42
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,847
- The milk truck comes every day.
- Yeah, but maybe not today.

43
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,479
Maybe it's changing routes.
Maybe this'll be the last we'll ever see of it.

44
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,955
Come on. It's just across the street.
We're cats. We like milk.

45
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,548
- Let's go for it.
- No.

46
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,957
- But, you... - But nothin'.

47
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,791
I don't leave
the cul-de-sac for anything.

48
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:26,388
Out there,
it's a hornet's nest of trouble.

49
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,596
Bad things happen out there.
So I don't go out there.

50
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,571
Besides, I've found
if you wait long enough...

51
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,041
everything comes to you.

52
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,568
* Here come the milkman
Here come the milkman *

53
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,309
- * He got his shoes on, he got his milk pan *
- Hey, Nermal...

54
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,351
let's play astronaut
again today.

55
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,648
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I love that game.

56
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,654
You're such a brave
little astronaut.

57
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:53,351
- All right.
- Prepare to jump into your spaceship,
Commander Nermal.

58
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,360
But wh-wh-what
about the milk?

59
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,293
- Who needs milk when you can be in outer space?
- Ah.

60
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,991
- You got a secret mission today.
- Yeah?

61
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,034
- You'll be exploring the Milky Way.
- Okay.

62
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,730
I get the chills when you jump
in your little spacecraft.

63
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,830
The nation thanks you.
Prepare to blast off.

64
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,102
- I'm ready to go, friend.
- Three, two, one.

65
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,269
Whoa!
Now I feel like it.

66
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,040
Bon voyage.

67
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:15,944
Look at me go!
Whoo-hoo!

68
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,006
- Don't look down!
- I'm an eagle flying!

69
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,848
Come to papa, baby.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,388
I can see everything up here.
I can see my house.

71
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,549
Got milk?

72
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:28,253
I can see
the whole neighborhood.

73
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,195
- Well, that's nice. That's very nice.
- Hey, there's another milk truck.

74
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,700
Ooh!
And that is even nicer.

75
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,201
- I can see... Whoa!
- Mission accomplished, Nermal.

76
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,738
Whoa! Whoa,
Garfield, do it again.

77
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,740
Where did everybody go?

78
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:45,369
You're on the wrong side
of the street, fat cat. Beat it!

79
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,970
And you, Luca, the wrong side
of the evolutionary curve.

80
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,140
Okay, that's it.

81
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,811
- You're gonna get it good today.
- I make a point to get it good every day.

82
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,821
The real question, Luca,
is how shall I outwit you this time?

83
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,585
- What?
- Shall I baffle you with simple math?

84
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,924
- I know how to spell.
- Or should I distract you with something shiny?

85
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,759
- Now you're making fun of me.
- I hope so. You're no fun to look at.

86
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,993
You'll never get
the best of me! Aaah!

87
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,436
- I think I just did.
- Not the ducks again!

88
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,963
Jump back!
And kiss myself.

89
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,170
Oooh!

90
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,510
If I ever get off this chain,
you're goin' down.

91
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,416
Everybody back up! I don't know
how wild this thing is gonna get.

92
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,614
I love the smell of
cinnamon-apple in the morning.

93
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,055
It smells like... victory.

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,787
Oooh!
I hate this fat cat.

95
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,092
So much time,
and so little I need to do.

96
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,035

97
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,334
Mouse!

98
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,375
No thanks, I'm full.

99
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,606
Get him, Garfield!

100
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,170
Get him, Jon!

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,954

102
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,786
Oh, it's always gotta be
smashing and crashing.

103
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,156
Nobody poisons anymore.

104
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,526
Aha!

105
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,293
Whoa...

106
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,130
There's my ball!

107
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,228
What good is a cat
that can't chase a mouse?

108
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,364
I don't do the chase thing.

109
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,636
All right,
I'll handle this.

110
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,304
I know you don't hear me,
but can't you just listen?

111
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,574

112
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,986
Louis, what are you doing
in the house when Jon's home?

113
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,024
Sorry, Garfield, man.
I couldn't help it.

114
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,583
Look, when he sees you, he expects
more from me. Don't you get that?

115
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,426
Jon's got those macadamia nut cookies.
I'm trying to maintain.

116
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:48,524
- You understand?
- Sure. As long as you understand I have to eat you.

117
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,626
Aw!

118
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,539

119
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,474
Mm. Mmm.

120
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,346

121
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,349
- Mm! Mmm!
- Oh, good boy.

122
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,079
See, I knew you could do it
if you put your mind to it.

123
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,213
- You are the best cat a guy could have.
- Mmm.

124
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:14,020
Mm! Mm!

125
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,426
Mmm.
M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Mm.

126
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,859
Have you tasted
yourself lately?

127
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,800
Hey, it wasn't exactly the first-class lounge
in there for me either.

128
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,931
Get yourself lost. Take a powder for a couple days,
get a haircut and grow a beard.

129
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,305
Cool.
I owe you one, "G."

130
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:33,777
I got a question for you.
Do you love your cat?

131
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,474
Finally, back on
my regular schedule.

132
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,450
You're gonna make sure
he has nothing but Kibbly Kat food.

133
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,453
Isn't that right,
Persnikitty?

134
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,958
That cat's puss is everywhere...
TV, newspapers, T-shirts.

135
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,858
Who would want
that kind of exposure?

136
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,192

137
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,995
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah, cut the small talk. What's in the bag?

138
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,297
Remember, be happy.

139
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,804
I'm happy when I'm with you,
you delicate mélange...

140
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:03,069
of tomato paste, ricotta cheese,
ground meat and pasta!

141
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,576
Garfield, don't even
think about it.

142
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,341
That's my food.

143
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,348
I may just nibble.

144
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,680
Thanks, Happy.
And thank you for joining us.

145
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,152
I'm Christopher Mello.
Remember...

146
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,553
Be happy.

147
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,925
- Okay, cut. Good.

148
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,461
- We're clear.

149
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,497
Give me the Benadryl.
Give me the Benadryl.

150
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,768
Yeah! Yeah.

151
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,133
Yeah! Yeah.

152
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,804
Damned cat allergies.

153
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,703

154
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,281
Any word
from the network yet?

155
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,216
Uh, no, but they're looking for a dog act
on Good Day, New York.

156
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,913
Dog act!
Story of my life.

157
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,513
Looking for a dog,
and I'm stuck with a cat.

158
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,525
I thought the segment
went quite well.

159
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,584
"I thought the segment went quite well."

160
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,595
Of course it went well,
you toad!

161
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,496
The 50 housewives
who saw it, loved it.

162
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:04,525
This is Walter J. Chapman
reporting live from The Hague.

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,902
Oh, please,
what a know-it-all!

164
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,634
...were met with angry crowds...

165
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,166
And everybody always said
I was the handsome one.

166
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,702
I was the smart one.
And I was born first.

167
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,716
But there you are
"live from The Hague':

168
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,982
And here I am working with this sack of dander
on a dead-end regional morning show.

169
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,457
Back to you, Dan.

170
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,424
Back to you, Dan.

171
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,928
Garfield!

172
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,931
- Did you eat all four boxes of lasagna?

173
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,832
It's not my fault. They started it.

174
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,766
What am I gonna do
with you?

175
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,635
Love me. Feed me.
Never leave me.

176
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,106
Come on. Let's go for a ride
to someplace you love...

177
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,939
that always leaves you
feeling pampered and refreshed.

178
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,913
Huh? Oh, I know...
Chuck E. Cheese.

179
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,415
Thank you.

180
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,784
No? Wendy's?
Taco Kitty? No?

181
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,882
Well, I'm stumped.
Maybe Olive Garden for you?

182
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,659
Hmm. The only time I ever leave my cul-de-sac
is when Jon takes me to the vet...

183
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:10,634
which he's been doing a lot recently,
and it appears to have nothing to do with me.

184
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,332
Jon must want to go
for his own reason.

185
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,967
Well, there's nothing wrong
with Garfield.

186
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,204
He's just a happy,
fat, lazy cat.

187
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,212
No need for
a second opinion.

188
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,407
- Well, I worry about him.
- I know you do.

189
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,575
Ooh!

190
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,552
You know, you care about him more than
any owner I've ever known.

191
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,590
"Him" has a name.
Is this an H.M.O?

192
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:35,388
Let's get Garfield in for his dip.
I wanna talk to you in private.

193
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,621
- Mm. Oh!
- She's so beautiful.

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,567
Uh, Mr. Pathetic, you've had a crush
on her since high school.

195
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:47,902
Would you please ask her out so she can
reject you, and we can get on with my life?

196
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:50,498
- I have to ask her out.

197
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,136
- Wish me luck.
- Okay, go get 'em, big tiger.

198
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,737
You the man. You the fella.
You the boss.

199
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,807
You preach to her. Show her how
the cow eats the cabbage...

200
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,444
you hopeless loser.

201
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,888
Betty, today, why don't you start me off
with a Swedish massage...

202
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,154
a manicure
and a pedicure, okay?

203
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,458
Seaweed wrap, loofah...

204
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,464
belly rub, uh...

205
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:16,365
tail waxing and then
crack my toes to finish.

206
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:20,166
Jon, there's something
important I need to ask you.

207
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,935
Something that I wouldn't ask
most guys who come in here.

208
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,875
Wait, no. I think I know
where this is going.

209
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,879
- You do?
- I do.

210
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:31,110
Liz, I've wanted to ask you
the same thing for a very long time.

211
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,811
- Are you sure that
we're talking about the same thing?
- Absolutely.

212
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,787
Yeah, uh, I've never been more sure
of anything in my entire life.

213
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,450
Liz, I am ready
to take a chance.

214
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,050
- I am ready for...

215
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,289
Thank you.

216
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,059
- A dog!

217
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,499
A dog.
I'm ready for a dog.

218
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,502
- Hi.

219
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,595
- Hey, I think he likes you.
- Hi. Yeah.

220
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:55,765
- Hi.

221
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:58,810
He's a frisky... frisky
little fella, isn't he?

222
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,176
His name's Odie,
and he's not gonna make it...

223
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,613
if he has to live
his life in a cage.

224
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,708
He needs to
be loved.

225
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,516

226
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,760
Well, thank you. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

227
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,492
- No, maybe not in my neighborhood.

228
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,525
Hey, Boomer,
I really gotta run.

229
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:28,835
Gotta fly, everybody. Really, please,
stay behind the security fences.

230
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,069
So great of you
to come out to see me...

231
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,112
but I've got somebody waiting for me,
very devoted, almost crippled.

232
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,114
- No, please, don't cry.

233
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:40,050
I know what it's like to be unloved.
Well, you do.

234
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,247
I'll try to come back and visit,
and if I don't, I'll try to write.

235
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,552
- Bye-bye.
- Does anybody know this guy?

236
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,218
Bye-bye, everybody.
Garfield is leaving the building.

237
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,694
Jon, you know you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

238
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,254
No. No, it's okay.

239
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,857
Some part of me always wanted
to know what it'd be like...

240
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,460
to have a pet that actually
wants to play with you.

241
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,471
You're a good friend.

242
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,235
One question... Am I still gorgeous?

243
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,808
Jon, I think we got
a little problem here.

244
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,870
- Uh, Jon...

245
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,109
I can help
the transition go smoothly.

246
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,583
Jon, it's in my seat. Jon!

247
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,587
- We could all go out together. Park, dog shows,
- Jon! Uh, Jon?

248
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,180
- Stuff like that.
- Uh, Jonny boy?

249
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,783
W-Wait a minute.
Are... Are you... asking me out?

250
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,727
Oh, Jonny boy, the time has come
to get a car alarm.

251
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,133
You're not gonna believe it. A mongrel mutt
has broken into your car!

252
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,933
Garfield, this is Odie.
He's coming home with us.

253
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,464
Whoa! You went in there to get a date
and came out with a dog?

254
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,944
Oh, that's bad even for you.
Oh, you're so sad!

255
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,744
Oh, no, no, no. We're not
bringing a dog home with us.

256
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,785
Hey, I ride shotgun!

257
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,317
What are you looking at, tick boy?

258
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,457
Jon, it's not too late.

259
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:57,393
Quickly, turn around...
before he finds out where we live!

260
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,057

261
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:03,295
Please take this
trouser sniffer back!

262
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,496
- Please.
- Come on, Odie. Let's go.

263
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,404
This is your new home.

264
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,466

265
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,843
Come on, buddy.

266
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:20,045
Jon, you had me,
a chick magnet...

267
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,486
and now you've got
a tick magnet.

268
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,648

269
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,988
Garfield,
Jon brought a dog home.

270
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,291
- I am aware, Nermal.
- Why would he do a thing like that?

271
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,464
Gee, I don't know, Nermal.

272
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:35,758
It just seems like
a weird thing to do...

273
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,700
bringing a dog into a house
that already has a cat.

274
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,294
Can we drop it?
I mean, it's no big... deal.

275
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:44,340
It's... just a splattered bug
on the windshield of my life.

276
00:15:44,408 --> 00:15:46,376
A bug?

277
00:15:46,443 --> 00:15:48,604
A dim-witted, smelly, goofy...

278
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,308
Splattered bug that I will deal with
appropriately and enthusiastically.

279
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,579
- Come on.
- As you can see, I'm still Jon's favorite.

280
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:58,553
See ya later, Garfield.
Good luck with the bug thing!

281
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:00,613
Come on.

282
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:05,553
This is payback
for the liver thing, isn't it?

283
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,757
Payback.
He's a nut.

284
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:13,132
This is your new home, Odie.
That's my office over there.

285
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,364
And, uh, the TV over there.

286
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,737
- And, uh, the kitchen.
- Hm.

287
00:16:17,808 --> 00:16:20,436
You wanna go see it?
Okay, go see the house. Go see it.

288
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,412
Why don't you draw him
a map?

289
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,712
Okay, I've gotta...
remain calm, that's all.

290
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:29,877
Jon's a cat guy,
not a dog guy.

291
00:16:29,953 --> 00:16:32,945
This'll last a week,
maybe 10 days. Tops.

292
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,959
Boy, this puppy
is stupid gone wild!

293
00:16:37,027 --> 00:16:41,259
Nah, this is just a bad dream. I'm gonna
close my eyes and when I open them...

294
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:43,561
everything will be
back to normal.

295
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:52,601
- Ah! That's not normal.

296
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,610
Not close.
Oh, great.

297
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:57,272
Dog cooties.
Somebody inoculate me, please.

298
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,180

299
00:17:02,252 --> 00:17:04,186
This is a nightmare. L...

300
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:08,122
I just need a little quality time
with man's real best friend...

301
00:17:08,191 --> 00:17:10,091
television.

302
00:17:11,795 --> 00:17:13,729

303
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:18,496
No, no, no. No, no. No.

304
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,629
Hey, new guy, let me hip you
to the rules, okay?

305
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,105
Number one...
that's my chair, all right?

306
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:29,407
I even see you raise a leg,
and it's on, it's go time, pal.

307
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,949
Very well.

308
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,178

309
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:50,656
Yeah, I think I just may have
a mental advantage on this guy.

310
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:06,607
Leave me alone.
I'm not kidding, Yodel Odie.

311
00:18:06,683 --> 00:18:10,380
Pop a worm pill
and hit the road. I'm busy.

312
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:14,481
You wanna play? Fine.
You can be my new astronaut.

313
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,789
Go jump in the pail,
and we'll shoot you into outer space.

314
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:21,319
Come on. It's real simple.
Here, I'll even throw your ball in there.

315
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,730
Follow the ball,
and jump in the pail.

316
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,995
Come on, Odie.
Just like this.

317
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:29,971
Come on over here and just jump
right into the pail, and help me.

318
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,201
Come on. No.
Just in here like this.

319
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:33,799
Uh-oh!
Don't touch that!

320
00:18:33,877 --> 00:18:36,402
Aaah!

321
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,007
Oh, no!

322
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,016
Whoa!

323
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,788
Aaah!

324
00:18:54,831 --> 00:18:56,765
Oh, no!

325
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:04,038
Houston, we have a problem.

326
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:07,099
Odie, get off the pail.

327
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,873
Would you get off
the pail, please?

328
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:12,244
Okay, time for a new game.

329
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,340
It's called
"my claw in your butt" game.

330
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:17,012
Come here! Get back here!

331
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,783
Come on!
I'll just use my left claw.

332
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:23,019
If my legs were longer,
I'd have caught you by now. Come here.

333
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,527
Just wait for one second.

334
00:19:25,595 --> 00:19:26,721
Slow... down.

335
00:19:26,797 --> 00:19:29,129
- Ahhh... 

336
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:32,566
Well, well, well.
I've got you now, fat cat.

337
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:36,197
Hey, Luca, is that a new chain
you're wearin', fella?

338
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:38,764
Looks good on ya. You look great.
You been working out?

339
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,811
Oh, I've been waiting
years for this.

340
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:44,142
- Would that be regular years or dog years?

341
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,774

342
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:49,751
What the... Get away
from me, pip-squeak.

343
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,779
Uh, Luca, this is Odie.
Odie, Luca.

344
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:56,121
Luca, do me a favor and eat him for me,
would you, please?

345
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,627
- Garfield, are you all right?
- I think so.

346
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:00,993
Luca's about
to have Odie for lunch.

347
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:03,589
If it wasn't for Odie,
you'd be Luca's chew toy.

348
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,067
Yeah, he saved your life.

349
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:09,663
- Odie's a hero!
- Why? Because I wasn't ripped to shreds?

350
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,573
No, Odie's an imbecile
until further notice.

351
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:15,372

352
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,379
Hey, moon dust...

353
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:20,109
if I were you, I'd grab
a nice piece of carpet.

354
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:22,674
Jon doesn't let me
sleep up top. Ever.

355
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:25,187

356
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:27,985
Odie... You wanna
sleep in the bed?

357
00:20:28,058 --> 00:20:29,992
Okay.

358
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,961
Wha...

359
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:36,430
Hey, buddy. Good boy.
Who's a good boy, huh?

360
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,434
You want to sleep
on the bed tonight?

361
00:20:38,502 --> 00:20:40,436
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

362
00:20:40,504 --> 00:20:44,099
I think I'm going
to blow cat-chow chunks.

363
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,165
Good night, Odie.
Good night, Garfield.

364
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,268
Great. Wish me luck
with the nightmares.

365
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:07,628
Another day ruined.

366
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:19,468
Oh, you little suck-up. Oh!

367
00:21:19,543 --> 00:21:23,206

368
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,749
Whoa! Whoa, baby.

369
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:34,318
No. Down.
Down, dumb dog.

370
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:42,159
What part of "no"
don't you understand?

371
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:47,101
The push off the chair?
Off. I don't want to play.

372
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,731
Oh! Look. What am I
supposed to say?

373
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:53,469
"Thanks for saving
my hide with Luca?"

374
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:56,205
Okay, thanks for saving
my hide with Luca. Get off.

375
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,343
Where was I? Right here.
I was right here.

376
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,782
Oh!

377
00:22:01,852 --> 00:22:03,786
That was a cheap shot.

378
00:22:03,854 --> 00:22:06,721
Hit a guy
when he's not looking? Okay.

379
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,623
Oh, excuse me. I-I think you
may have forgotten something.

380
00:22:09,693 --> 00:22:12,594
I saw this and I thought,
pretty sure it was your...

381
00:22:12,662 --> 00:22:15,893
Oh, I love to dish it out.

382
00:22:15,966 --> 00:22:19,902
- Watch out. You see, you can't touch this.

383
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,904
Come on.
Uh-huh.

384
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:26,102
That's right.
Don't sneak up on me, baby.

385
00:22:26,176 --> 00:22:29,373
Oh, come on with that.

386
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:31,607
Get that weak stuff outta here.

387
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,615
Is that butt broken?

388
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:35,810
No, it's something
like this here.

389
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:38,480
Can you do this?

390
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:42,321
Uh, shouldn't those hips be in the shop?
Walk this way, please.

391
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:45,189
I'm-a walking the dog.

392
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,628
Well, step it up a little bit.
Something like this.

393
00:22:49,666 --> 00:22:51,896
Ho, look at this.
Watch out for this thing.

394
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:55,335
It could go. Uh-huh.

395
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:57,430
You probably should've
practiced in the garage...

396
00:22:57,507 --> 00:22:59,975
before you stepped up
to someone of my level.

397
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:02,911
Back up.
Come on.

398
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:05,812
Fly with me. Maybe something
a little bit more challenging.

399
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:09,511
Hey! How 'bout this?
Out the front door.

400
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,487
Take it outside!

401
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:14,921
Look who's here
on the porch.

402
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:18,791
I'm walking the porch.
I'm holding a torch. I'm ready to scorch.

403
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,592
Uh-huh.
That's fancy footwork.

404
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:23,599
Hey! Look. Garfield's
dancing with Odie.

405
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,430
They're like buddies now!

406
00:23:25,502 --> 00:23:28,801
What's the matter? Oh, my God!
Odie, what are you doing here?

407
00:23:28,872 --> 00:23:32,535
I was doing a solo dance,
and a creepy dog comes up next to me?

408
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:33,576
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.

409
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,271
Did you guys see that?
Thank you, fellas. Thank you.

410
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,813
Uh-oh.
Here's more trouble.

411
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:46,178
Look at the goony look
on his face.

412
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:49,714
- Come on, buddy. Come here. Come on.
- Taking him back to the vet?

413
00:23:49,793 --> 00:23:52,557
- Time for our date with Liz.
- Takin' him back to the kennel, right?

414
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,395
Yeah? Are you putting
him up for adoption?

415
00:23:56,466 --> 00:24:00,232
Hey, Garfield,
Jon's taking Odie on his date with Liz...

416
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:03,500
- and he's leaving you behind.
- I know, Nermal.

417
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,201
They're off
on an adventure and you're still here.

418
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:08,210
And your point is?

419
00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:10,405
Well, that's gotta feel bad...

420
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,210
being left by Jon
while he takes Odie out.

421
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:16,047
It's like you're not
his favorite anymore.

422
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:18,485
Hey, what do you say
we play brain surgeon?

423
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,217
Would you go get my power tools?

424
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,359
This is so sad.

425
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,486
Jon has completely
lost his mind.

426
00:24:26,563 --> 00:24:29,691
Doesn't realize
how important I am to him.

427
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,098
I need to be so very
understanding of him...

428
00:24:32,168 --> 00:24:34,432
at this difficult time.

429
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:37,940
Hey, wait up! Wait up for me!
You forgot me!

430
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:41,375
Slow down! Please slow down!
I'm right back here!

431
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:45,039
Waa... oh! I think
I pulled a hamstring.

432
00:24:48,752 --> 00:24:52,051
All right. It's okay.
I'm on. I'm on. Relax.

433
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:58,727
Oh, my poor nose.

434
00:24:58,795 --> 00:24:59,496
So, if you own Marie,
please come and claim her.

435
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:02,863
So, if you own Marie,
please come and claim her.

436
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:05,958
Thank you very much.

437
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:11,338
Now, before the show starts, go over
to the snack section on the south lawn...

438
00:25:11,408 --> 00:25:13,569
and get those goodies.

439
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:15,611
We have things there
that we're sure...

440
00:25:15,678 --> 00:25:19,205
Yeah, go on ahead. Uh...

441
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:22,445
I'll catch up with ya.
It's probably just a mild concussion...

442
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:24,612
or... or a skull fracture.

443
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:26,882
Maybe I'll get a CAT scan.

444
00:25:26,956 --> 00:25:29,584
A CAT scan!

445
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:31,991
I'd like to ask the judges now...

446
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:35,088
if they would please
take their positions for the viewings.

447
00:25:35,165 --> 00:25:37,861
Oh, watch your step there.

448
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:44,940

449
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:48,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the dog show.

450
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:50,245
Well, what if I
compromise a little?

451
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:53,578
How 'bout I do the rolling around
with the yarn ball thing?

452
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:59,020
And I'll purr. I'll purr like a Ferrari.
Or make that a Jaguar.

453
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:03,924
I won't climb drapes though. That's more
than you get from some dumb dog.

454
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,587
Oops. Dogs.
Uh-oh.

455
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:09,962
- Oh, what? You're all gonna take it personally?
- Down, boy. Sit.

456
00:26:10,033 --> 00:26:12,126
- Stay!
- Now, I'm gonna die.

457
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:15,638
Oh, now I really
am gonna die!

458
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:17,639
Excuse me.
Can I get through here?

459
00:26:17,707 --> 00:26:20,972
- No one under this tarp. Ah! That's my ear!

460
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:23,171
Owners, maintain control of your dogs.

461
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:26,044
People, control
those animals now!

462
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:29,017
Music! Music, you idiot!

463
00:26:29,085 --> 00:26:31,053

464
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:34,022
- Yeah, play the music.

465
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,217
That's my bad knee. Stop it. All right!

466
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:39,784
- Feets, don't fail me now!

467
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:44,129
I apologize for this.
Please excuse this outburst.

468
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,498
- This is highly irregular.
- Odie! Odie! 

469
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:49,561
Odie! Odie, come on.
Come on, buddy. Come on back.

470
00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:51,630
Odie! Odie, you want a treat?
Huh? Buddy?

471
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:53,972

472
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:56,739
Okay. All right.
I need a ride.

473
00:26:56,813 --> 00:26:59,077
I'm a cat in trouble.
I'm hitching a ride in your muumuu.

474
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:00,844
- Ooh!
- Come on! Let's move!

475
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:04,648
- Go! Let's move! Dig! Dig! Hyah! Hyah!

476
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:08,179
Come on, Pinkie. Move it out!
Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

477
00:27:12,128 --> 00:27:15,586
Move! Move! Move, Pinkie!
Move, Pinkie! Move!

478
00:27:15,665 --> 00:27:18,429
We certainly have
a new star in the arena.

479
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,034
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is amazing!

480
00:27:24,474 --> 00:27:27,068
Talented little fella, huh?

481
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:32,244
Hyah, Pinkie! Hyah!
They're gaining on us, Pinkie!

482
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:35,409
A cat's life is at stake. Whoa!

483
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:38,610
Thanks for the ride.

484
00:27:38,688 --> 00:27:41,122
Excuse me, ma'am.
Please call 911.

485
00:27:42,292 --> 00:27:44,351
Please!

486
00:27:44,427 --> 00:27:46,588
This is exactly
what I deserve anyway.

487
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:51,763
I promise if I survive,
I'll never compete with a dog again.

488
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,800
Okay! You got me!

489
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:58,534
But before I say good-bye...
Oh, isn't this the final irony?

490
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:01,441
Look who's here to witness this.
The mailman!

491
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:03,945
You're so stupid.

492
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:05,913

493
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,416
Whoo! Yeah!

494
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,280
Whoo. Whoo-hoo.

495
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:14,118

496
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,091
Yes!

497
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,926
Odie, come here.
That's a good boy. Oh, hi.

498
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:24,194
Ladies and gentlemen, Happy Chapman.

499
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:29,068
That is one talented dog!

500
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:31,129

501
00:28:31,207 --> 00:28:33,835
You know, this is exactly
the kind of dog...

502
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,935
that could have
a future in television.

503
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:39,072
Oh, thank you, Mr. Chapman,
but Odie's just my pet.

504
00:28:39,148 --> 00:28:41,343
And that's... that's all
I really want him to be.

505
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:44,511
- You're kidding.
- No.

506
00:28:44,587 --> 00:28:47,852
Okay. Well,
this is for you.

507
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:49,858
And, uh...

508
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,588
this is for you if you
happen to change your mind.

509
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,960
You just ring me up.
You give..."Hello? Hello?

510
00:28:55,031 --> 00:28:57,192
I changed my mind.
I wanna be a star."

511
00:28:57,267 --> 00:28:59,258
- Okay.
- Okay!

512
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:02,395
- Okay.
- Let's hear it for Odie!

513
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:06,169
What a sensational ending
to a rather unconventional show!

514
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:09,177
- Smile.
- Our winner today...

515
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:13,583
a fabulous dancing puppy
called Odie!

516
00:29:13,716 --> 00:29:16,241
...the cul-de-sac. Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

517
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,379
N-Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de-sac.

518
00:29:19,455 --> 00:29:22,686
Never leave the cul-de-sac.
Never leave the cul-de...

519
00:29:22,758 --> 00:29:27,218
I'm h-home.

520
00:29:27,296 --> 00:29:30,129
- I had fun today. Thank you.
- Yeah, me too.

521
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,633
Would you like to come in?

522
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,863
- Uh, not today.
- I knew that.

523
00:29:34,937 --> 00:29:36,962
- I'm sorry.
- Jon, I wanna come over, just not today.

524
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,872
I have to cover
for another vet.

525
00:29:39,942 --> 00:29:42,001
Oh! Really?

526
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:44,672
How's Sunday?

527
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:48,239
Sunday is... Sunday's great.
S-Sunday's good. Sunday.

528
00:29:48,317 --> 00:29:50,308
Okay.

529
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,115
So, I'll...

530
00:29:56,192 --> 00:29:58,660
- I'll see you Sunday.
- Sunday.

531
00:29:58,728 --> 00:30:00,662
- Sunday.

532
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,362
Why? Why has this happened?

533
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:10,633
I was the one.
It was all about me.

534
00:30:10,706 --> 00:30:14,836
Not about some stupid,
sniveling, smelly...

535
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,743
high-maintenance disco dog.

536
00:30:20,082 --> 00:30:22,346
Ahh!

537
00:30:31,694 --> 00:30:33,787
Oh, no.

538
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,965

539
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:52,003

540
00:30:56,719 --> 00:30:58,914
Huh? Oh...

541
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:06,792

542
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:19,437
You just can't do this, Jon. He's trying
to tear us apart. Don't you see that?

543
00:31:19,508 --> 00:31:21,908
You know me. I'm too lazy
to try to destroy your house.

544
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:25,310
I was provoked, pushed,
prodded, driven mad.

545
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:29,010
You can't kick me out of my own house
like I'm some kind of animal!

546
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:31,887
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon!

547
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:32,410
Oh, come on, Jon. Jon!

548
00:31:32,488 --> 00:31:36,117
You know I'm scared
of the dark.

549
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,326
Yeah, that's a good boy.
Who's a good boy?

550
00:31:41,397 --> 00:31:45,265
* Used to have Jon to myself *

551
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:50,033
* Day or night
There was no one else *

552
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:53,837
* From dawn to dusk
my meals would come *

553
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:58,346
* I'd lounge about in my home *

554
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:01,440
* But now I'm out
in the cold of night *

555
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:07,319
* All alone till
the dawn's first light *

556
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:13,350
* I'm in a new dog
state of mind *

557
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:23,498
* Used to think I had a home *

558
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:27,975
* A special place
to call my own *

559
00:32:28,043 --> 00:32:31,843
* But now the dog's in
and I'm out *

560
00:32:31,914 --> 00:32:37,216
* I've got no Jon
I've got no clout *

561
00:32:37,286 --> 00:32:40,517

562
00:32:45,995 --> 00:32:51,900
* I'm in a new dog
state of mind *

563
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:55,503

564
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:03,607
Leave me alone.
You've won.

565
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,773
You're inside with him,
and I'm out here all by myself.

566
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:37,475
Odie? You came out here
to be with me?

567
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:39,639
I'm touched.

568
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:43,481
- And you must be touched in the head.

569
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:47,420

570
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,050
- See you in the morning, little fella.

571
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:55,085
You know, a puppy needs a little tough love
every now and then.

572
00:33:55,164 --> 00:33:57,496
I think it builds character.

573
00:33:57,566 --> 00:33:59,864
Hello, Pooky. Miss me?

574
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:03,393
You know what? I'm gonna
make it up to Odie tomorrow.

575
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:06,270
I'm going to teach him how to
drink out of the toilet.

576
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:08,674
- Poor Odie.

577
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:11,611
- That cat is such a pig.
- Garfield's a pig?

578
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,739
You never put
the dog out at night.

579
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:16,512
Why not?

580
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,746
Because dogs...
run away.

581
00:34:18,821 --> 00:34:22,086

582
00:34:23,192 --> 00:34:25,183

583
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,771

584
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,827

585
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:06,557

586
00:35:34,129 --> 00:35:36,063

587
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:43,500

588
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:48,566
Sure, Jon, I'll eat
all your lasagna for you.

589
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:59,387
Oh, look.
What do we have here?

590
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:02,720
You're a lost dog.

591
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:05,555

592
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:08,289
Well, we can fix that.

593
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:10,298

594
00:36:13,969 --> 00:36:16,460
Oh, do I feel good
this morning.

595
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:20,030
I slept like a fat cat.

596
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:22,339
Hey, tall, dark and human,
what's for breakfast?

597
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:25,039
Odie! Where
are you, boy?

598
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:28,242
Well, relax. Uh, I think
he was going to camp out.

599
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:35,054
- Odie?
- Well, he probably had
a sleepover at Luca's, I think.

600
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:40,557
Odie! Odie?

601
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:44,360
Hm. Well, maybe he's fetching
the paper for the neighbors.

602
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,103
Where is that silly dog?

603
00:36:53,709 --> 00:36:56,177
I can't go on like this
anymore, Wendell.

604
00:36:56,245 --> 00:36:58,179
I've got to get a dog.

605
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,215
I think that's a lovely idea.

606
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:03,513
I know you've been sad and lonely since
the divorce, and I've tried to be a friend...

607
00:37:03,585 --> 00:37:05,519
Not for me, you imbecile.
For the act.

608
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:09,921
If I could get my hands on
a really talented dog...

609
00:37:09,992 --> 00:37:14,122
wouldn't Walter J.
Just choke on his Emmy?

610
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:16,824
- Like Odie?
- Yeah.

611
00:37:16,899 --> 00:37:20,164
Yeah, now he was good.

612
00:37:20,235 --> 00:37:24,672
Oh, yeah. You know, he was
kinda dopey-looking and spry.

613
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,674
- And...
- Lost!

614
00:37:26,742 --> 00:37:28,767
Hmm?

615
00:37:33,382 --> 00:37:37,011
Hi, it's Jon. I was just calling to see
if Odie's been over there.

616
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:39,884
My name is Jon Arbuckle,
and, um, I can't find my dog.

617
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:42,788
I've looked all around the neighborhood,
and I can't find him.

618
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:44,723
I saw him last night, but I
haven't seen him this morning.

619
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:47,387
And, uh, if you see him,
give me a call, please.

620
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:50,899
Uh, I was calling to see if you'd seen Odie?
Um, I think he's run away.

621
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:54,458
I was giving him a bath,
and I forgot to put his collar back on.

622
00:37:54,536 --> 00:37:56,470
You know, 'cause
Garfield hates his collar.

623
00:37:56,538 --> 00:38:00,201
He's about 15 pounds.
He's brownish yellow with brown floppy ears.

624
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:02,903
- Would you mind getting that?

625
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:05,538
Um, I'm offering a reward.

626
00:38:05,614 --> 00:38:08,708
Yeah, that's right.
Okay, and he answers to the name of...

627
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:11,810
- Hi.
- Hi. 

628
00:38:11,887 --> 00:38:14,913
I'd say the refrigerator
is unguarded.

629
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,685
Wh... What are you
doing here?

630
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,851
We're having dinner,
remember?

631
00:38:18,927 --> 00:38:21,828
Right! R...
Dinner.

632
00:38:21,897 --> 00:38:24,832
Th-The two of us.
Tonight. Of course.

633
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:28,593
- Shall I come in?
- Yeah!

634
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,433
Yeah.
Come on in.

635
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,503
Uh, you know, uh, Liz,
I have a confession.

636
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:38,705
Uh, uh, it's not really a confession.
More of an admission.

637
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,112
It's a... You know what it is?
It's like a, uh...

638
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:43,344
It's like a declaration.
I have a... a... d...

639
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,750
I love it
when you do that.

640
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:48,051
- Do what?
- You know, trip over yourself.

641
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:50,057
It's cute.

642
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:53,754
It's one of the reasons I had
a crush on you in high school.

643
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:55,763
You had a crush on me?

644
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:58,994
Yeah. I thought you were
really cute, decent.

645
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,297
Not like all those
other jerks.

646
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,804
I don't believe it. L...
I had a crush on you too.

647
00:39:03,872 --> 00:39:06,363
- Isn't that funny?
- Yeah.

648
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:08,375
Hilarious.

649
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:13,881
So, um, what's your confession/
admission/declaration?

650
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:16,918
Actually, um...

651
00:39:18,954 --> 00:39:21,582
I forgot about our dinner.
Yeah.

652
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:24,649
Oh, that's okay.
You know, I can... I can go.

653
00:39:24,726 --> 00:39:27,320
No. No, I'm...
I'm glad you're here.

654
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:30,388
Let me just, uh, get my jacket,
and then we'll go.

655
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:38,402
Okay, what am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

656
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:42,671
What... What am I gonna do?
I've waited for this night my entire life.

657
00:39:42,744 --> 00:39:45,406
If you tell her the truth,
you'll feel much better.

658
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,074
And you won't have to
see her anymore.

659
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,744
It's kinda creepy having a vet
around the house anyway.

660
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:53,344
I can't just go out and pretend like
nothing's happened, can I?

661
00:39:53,422 --> 00:39:57,017
Well, I sure could. The one thing you can't do
is tell her the dog's gone.

662
00:39:57,092 --> 00:40:00,061
- I gotta tell her.
- No.

663
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,961
- I've gotta tell her.
- No. That's not what I said.

664
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:05,431
Schmuck.

665
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,469
Liz, uh,
we can't go out tonight.

666
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:11,131
- Why not?
- Odie's run away.

667
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:13,970
- What?
- He got out last night. I feel terrible.

668
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,976
I called the pound.
I put up posters.

669
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:18,035
I looked everywhere,
but I can't find him.

670
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,741
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I guess I figured...

671
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:23,512
he was the only reason you were
spending time with me.

672
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:27,112
- Come on.
- No, I'm serious. I mean, I thought...

673
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:29,657
No, I mean, come on.
Let's go find him.

674
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:31,659
O-Oh.

675
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:38,731
Ayayayayay.

676
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,897
How can this dog be such a problem
when he's not even here anymore?

677
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:46,133
Well, I'm not gonna
worry about him.

678
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,506
I believe you've
found my dog.

679
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:51,705
- He answers to "Odie."
- "Odie"?

680
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,577
Family name.

681
00:40:55,651 --> 00:40:58,142
Oh! Odie!
Oh, come on.

682
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,314
There you are. Oh!

683
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,520
Yes. Yes.

684
00:41:05,594 --> 00:41:10,327
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I can live again now.

685
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:12,333
How could I ever
repay you?

686
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,665
An autograph
would be splendid.

687
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,829
Then splendid
it shall be.

688
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:20,700
- - Hm.

689
00:41:20,776 --> 00:41:23,040
- Uh, no.
- Come on, boy.

690
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,442

691
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,037

692
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:29,515
Hmm...

693
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:32,883
Ooh.

694
00:41:32,954 --> 00:41:35,889
This is ridiculous.

695
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:39,358
- Hey, what are you lookin' at?
- Nothin'. Just lookin' for some company.

696
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:41,020
Keep walking, creepo.

697
00:41:41,096 --> 00:41:43,929
- What's going on?
- We know how much you hated Odie.

698
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:46,399
- We know how much you wanted him gone.
- Wait a minute.

699
00:41:46,468 --> 00:41:48,265
All I wanted was
to sleep in my own bed.

700
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:51,238
And to do it, you cast Odie out
into the cold, cruel world?

701
00:41:51,306 --> 00:41:53,536
We saw how you locked
Odie outside last night.

702
00:41:53,608 --> 00:41:57,442
Oh, I don't believe you guys.
I didn't know he was gonna run away.

703
00:41:57,512 --> 00:41:59,810
He's a dumb dog.
No offense, Luca.

704
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:02,076
- Uh, what?
- You can't blame me for that.

705
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,744
- Any one of us could be next.
- Yeah.

706
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:07,914
There's no room for anybody else
in Garfield's world.

707
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,048
Huh? Oh, that's
a little dramatic.

708
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:14,061
Well, I may have been a little tough
about protecting my turf...

709
00:42:14,129 --> 00:42:18,259
but, uh,
I don't hate the guy.

710
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,528
I understand Happy
has a big surprise for us.

711
00:42:20,602 --> 00:42:22,797
A special treat.
What have you got for us, Hap?

712
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:24,805
Ah, guten Morgen, Chris.

713
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:28,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have been working
with a very special new friend...

714
00:42:28,477 --> 00:42:32,345
and I would like
to introduce him to all of you.

715
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:35,645
Odieschnitzel!

716
00:42:37,419 --> 00:42:40,183
Lookee here!
It's Odie!

717
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,189
And he's safe and sound.

718
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:45,954
Although, he seems to have found
an alternative lifestyle.

719
00:42:46,027 --> 00:42:47,961
He still can't dance.

720
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:49,963
Well, this gets me off the hook
with Jon and the gang.

721
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:53,398
- Now I'm gonna be the hero.
- That's one talented dog.

722
00:42:53,468 --> 00:42:58,201
Oh, I'm glad you think so, Chris,
because I have a little announcement to make.

723
00:42:58,273 --> 00:43:00,366
Old Happy Chapman
and Odieschnitzel...

724
00:43:00,442 --> 00:43:04,037
are going to be climbing aboard
that New Amsterdam Limited at 3:00 p. M...

725
00:43:04,112 --> 00:43:06,876
bound to New York City,
where we have the opportunity...

726
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:10,509
to be regular contributors
on Good Day, New York.

727
00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:13,520
Huh? That's his last name...
Schnitzel?

728
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:16,785
Thank you for all your help yesterday.
You were... You were great.

729
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:19,827
Jon, Odie's on TV,
and he's wearing lederhosen.

730
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:22,227
I-I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.

731
00:43:22,297 --> 00:43:25,357
Um, I upped the reward
to, um, $200.

732
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,368
And, uh, I'm going to put up
some more posters tomorrow.

733
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,631
He's clog dancing, I think,
wearing lederhosen.

734
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:32,730
I'm sorry.
Garfield, not now.

735
00:43:32,808 --> 00:43:35,368
- Oh, you're gonna miss it.
- I'm sorry, Liz. I'll call you later.

736
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:37,674
Garfield's
being... Garfield.

737
00:43:37,746 --> 00:43:40,010
Do I have to bark
like Lassie?

738
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:42,049
Come on.
Humor me, would ya?

739
00:43:42,117 --> 00:43:44,608
Arf. Arf. Arf.
Quickly!

740
00:43:44,686 --> 00:43:47,484
While we're young.
Today! Let's go!

741
00:43:47,556 --> 00:43:49,581
Be happy.

742
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:53,150
Oh, you're gonna miss this. He's the small one.
The small one in the guy's hand.

743
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:55,389

744
00:43:55,464 --> 00:43:58,365
Garfield, I'm not in the mood.

745
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:03,265
You know, it's never good
when you turn off my TV.

746
00:44:03,338 --> 00:44:05,704
And this may be
the worst ever.

747
00:44:05,774 --> 00:44:07,708
Odie's not ready.

748
00:44:07,776 --> 00:44:11,576
H-He's months of positive reinforcement
away from consistently performing.

749
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:20,846
Happy, you promised
you'd never use that.

750
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:22,719
I mean, that collar
is inhumane.

751
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:25,817
This collar...

752
00:44:25,894 --> 00:44:29,330
is the dog's future.

753
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:32,389
Do you have a problem
with that?

754
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,662
- No.
- No.

755
00:44:34,736 --> 00:44:38,297
Now we'll see how smart
you really are.

756
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,735
Happy Chapman. Happy Chapman.
Happy Chapman.

757
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:47,145
Not now, Garfield.

758
00:44:47,215 --> 00:44:49,683
Jon, you're denser
than ever.

759
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:52,151
- I gotta think outside the box here.

760
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,814
- Hey, the box!

761
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,824
Wait a second.

762
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,360
My box... My box
had something on it.

763
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,058
Let's see. Apple Jacks.
Frosted Flakes. Cocoa Puffs.

764
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:08,660
Kibbly Kat.
Yes, there it is.

765
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:13,697
Telegraph Tower. That's where they make
The Happy Chapman Show.

766
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:16,642
Yeah. But how far away
can that be?

767
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:19,475
Maybe...
Hmm, a paw?

768
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:23,450
A paw and a half maybe.
This is a done deal. I can do this.

769
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:26,612
No!

770
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:30,647
Can't do this.
Reached physical limits.

771
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,023
Shouldn't have tried it
without snacks.

772
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:36,029
Must go back and reload.

773
00:45:36,097 --> 00:45:39,328
- Jenny, how are you? Welcome to the show.

774
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:42,503
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

775
00:45:42,636 --> 00:45:45,332
- Mmm. Mmm.

776
00:45:45,405 --> 00:45:48,306
Mmm.

777
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:51,071
Ah, and that's the sign
that the tank is full.

778
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:55,238
I can do this. Beyond this intersection
is just another intersection.

779
00:45:55,315 --> 00:45:57,579
And another and another.

780
00:45:57,651 --> 00:46:01,087
On the other hand, I wonder if there's
any meat loaf left in the fridge.

781
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:03,622
No. Now's not the time
for a plate of meat loaf.

782
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,658
Now's the time
for a plate of courage.

783
00:46:05,726 --> 00:46:11,164
Ladies and gentlemen,
Garfield has left the cul-de-sac.

784
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:23,173
* He is trampling out
the vintage where the grapes
of wrath are stored *

785
00:46:23,243 --> 00:46:25,871
- * He has... *

786
00:46:27,581 --> 00:46:30,709
Now that's more my style.

787
00:46:30,784 --> 00:46:32,547
Oh, taxi.

788
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,951
Step on it, will you, driver?

789
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:45,158
No, Odie's not a hound dog.
Yes, I'm sure.

790
00:46:45,232 --> 00:46:47,962
No, I don't want
another dog.

791
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,969
- Thanks anyway.

792
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:52,562
Garfield, lunchtime.

793
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,468
I made your favorite...
lasagna.

794
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:02,681
Garfield!

795
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:05,818
Garfield!

796
00:47:06,887 --> 00:47:08,821
Garfield, where are you?

797
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:15,623
Can anyone direct me
to the pink building...

798
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:19,097
that's shown on the back
of the Kibbly Kat box?

799
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:23,262
Uh, it's the one right by
the blue-and-orange tree.

800
00:47:24,404 --> 00:47:27,737
Well, this doesn't feel
pink building-ish.

801
00:47:28,842 --> 00:47:30,332

802
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:33,038
- Hello?
- Now where you going? Oh, what is that?

803
00:47:33,113 --> 00:47:35,206
- Uh-oh, rats.
- Come on! Come on!

804
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:37,341
- Rats the size of rats.
- Come on, kids.

805
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,351
Is that big orange blob a cat?

806
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:41,910
Hey, now, why am I
being surrounded here?

807
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:44,856
- Some of my best friends are vermin.

808
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:46,722
- Finally, some meat.

809
00:47:46,793 --> 00:47:49,421
Meat? No, it's not meat.
I'm... They measured.

810
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:52,590
It's 100% body fat.
No nutritional value whatsoever.

811
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,429
Hey, body fat's
good with us.

812
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:56,560
- Mmm. Yea! Yippee!
- Uh... Uh... Louis.

813
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:59,902
- Garfield! Coming through.
Hey, what's going on here?
- Oh, it's my friend.

814
00:47:59,973 --> 00:48:02,908
Come on, Louis.
I got 3,000 teeny mouths to feed.

815
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:05,444
Hey, back off. Garfield?
What are you doing here?

816
00:48:05,512 --> 00:48:09,141
Besides defending my life?
Jon got a dog...

817
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:12,083
dog got kidnapped by a TV star,
I'm trying to rescue him.

818
00:48:12,152 --> 00:48:14,245
Seems like you got yourself
in a jam, huh?

819
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:16,414
I wish there was something
I could do to help you out.

820
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:19,425
Louis, I think you and I
have an account still, remember?

821
00:48:19,493 --> 00:48:22,587
- The macadamia nut cookies?
- I do love the macadamia.

822
00:48:22,663 --> 00:48:25,188
- Sorry, rat pack, this cat's with me.
- Aw, come on.

823
00:48:25,265 --> 00:48:27,665
Y'all got to roll.
Go ahead. Roll out.

824
00:48:27,734 --> 00:48:31,101
Who wants to go
to the Red Lobster alley?

825
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:33,935
Hey, maybe next time,
little critters.

826
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:36,100
Good luck with the plague
and rabies and everything.

827
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:37,973
Don't push your luck, fat cat.

828
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:42,312
Garfield, you can't just
be wandering around the city.

829
00:48:42,382 --> 00:48:44,612
There are dangers everywhere.

830
00:48:44,685 --> 00:48:47,279
Potholes, subways,
animal control.

831
00:48:47,354 --> 00:48:49,618
You think you can get me
to Telegraph Tower?

832
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:53,057
Two more cookies and you got a deal.
But we gotta keep it on the down-low.

833
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:55,287
How down low do we have to go?

834
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:57,592
Yo, Garfield, you with me?

835
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:00,599
Louis, this is a little bit
lower than I expected.

836
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:03,795
If I didn't have a box over my head,
I'd be humiliated.

837
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:08,802
Okay, hold up. All right.
We're almost there.

838
00:49:08,875 --> 00:49:12,538
Now, when I give you the signal,
we gotta cross the street.

839
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:16,378
- Way over there by the horizon?
- Come on, Garfield. Let's go!

840
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,350
Wait up! Wait up!

841
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,487

842
00:49:21,555 --> 00:49:23,546

843
00:49:23,623 --> 00:49:27,218
- Am I dead?
- Garfield, don't move!

844
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:29,387
Don't move?
Not a problem.

845
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:31,693
Just wait for the walk signal.

846
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,302
Oh, no, it's a stampede!
Stampede!

847
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:39,804
- If I can just get away from this herd.
- Garfield!

848
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:43,176
Garfield!

849
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:45,734
Garfield, where are you?

850
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:48,178
Garfield, get down
from there, man.

851
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:50,716
No. I'm not coming down.

852
00:49:50,784 --> 00:49:53,719
I'm happy to live the rest of my life
up here. Thank you.

853
00:49:58,792 --> 00:50:01,192
Liz! Liz!

854
00:50:01,261 --> 00:50:04,128
- What's wrong?
- Garfield's gone. I think he's run away too.

855
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:07,189
First Odie, and now Garfield.
Liz, I am the worst pet owner on the planet.

856
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:09,428
- Wait. What happened?
- I can't find him. You gotta help me.

857
00:50:09,503 --> 00:50:11,437
I can't live
without Garfield.

858
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,807
Let's start at the park.

859
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:14,239
Let's start at the park.

860
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:17,299
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

861
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:19,845
Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

862
00:50:19,913 --> 00:50:22,438
Garfield, relax.
Look. We're here.

863
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,450
- We're here now.
- Curb service.

864
00:50:25,552 --> 00:50:29,215
The Telegraph Tower
in all its splendor.

865
00:50:32,292 --> 00:50:34,817
It looks much smaller on the box.

866
00:50:34,895 --> 00:50:37,386
You gotta go all the way up there?
Good luck, playa.

867
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:39,796
I'll catch you later.
I don't do the vertical thing.

868
00:50:39,866 --> 00:50:42,198
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- Oh, yeah. Hold up, "G."

869
00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:44,829
- What?
- Watch out for the po-po.

870
00:50:44,905 --> 00:50:47,772
- You know, five-oh? Control-oh.
- Huh?

871
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,571
- Animal control, man.
- Oh, that po-po.

872
00:50:50,644 --> 00:50:53,204
- Keep it squeal.
- Hey, thanks, partner.

873
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,714
Oink, oink.

874
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:59,377
I can't try the door. I couldn't
handle another stampede.

875
00:51:04,658 --> 00:51:06,751
Hey...

876
00:51:06,827 --> 00:51:09,762

877
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,957
First thing Monday morning...

878
00:51:12,032 --> 00:51:15,729
I'm gonna get to work
on losing those last 20 pounds.

879
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:24,565
Okay, everything
looks good out there.

880
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:26,669
Looks like we got ourselves
a blockage.

881
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,279

882
00:51:32,886 --> 00:51:34,820
Hmm.

883
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:37,948
Guess we'll just...
purge the system.

884
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,562

885
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,560
- Oh, pardon me.

886
00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:51,866
That wasn't my stomach, was it?

887
00:51:51,938 --> 00:51:55,430
- Ah, there's a cooling breeze.

888
00:51:55,508 --> 00:51:57,669
Ooh. Woah!

889
00:51:57,744 --> 00:52:02,340
Woah!

890
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,056
- Whee!
- Aaah!

891
00:52:10,123 --> 00:52:12,023
Aaah!

892
00:52:15,996 --> 00:52:19,864
Oh, my poor nose.

893
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:23,602
Jon, stop the car.

894
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:31,768
- What?
- It's Odie.

895
00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:35,042
Somebody found him.
52903 Euclid Street.

896
00:52:35,115 --> 00:52:37,481
Let's go.

897
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,285
Odie!

898
00:52:38,285 --> 00:52:39,877
Odie!

899
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:42,649
Ode!

900
00:52:43,957 --> 00:52:46,084
Ode-ster!

901
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,525
Ode-man.

902
00:52:48,595 --> 00:52:51,496
This rescue thing
is exhausting.

903
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:53,498
When do heroes
get to eat?

904
00:52:53,566 --> 00:52:55,591
- Oh, my!

905
00:52:55,669 --> 00:52:57,830
- It's Odie!

906
00:52:57,904 --> 00:53:02,671
O-O-O-O...

907
00:53:02,742 --> 00:53:06,337
Odie.
I found you.

908
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,779
I'm so sorry
I got you into this mess.

909
00:53:08,848 --> 00:53:11,510
Look. We kind of got off
on the wrong paw.

910
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:15,020
But, come on. You can be
really annoying sometimes.

911
00:53:15,088 --> 00:53:16,919
And you don't give me
enough space.

912
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,550
And you're
a major-league suck-up.

913
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:23,892
But we have a common purpose.
We share Jon.

914
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:25,989
Jon needs us even more.

915
00:53:26,066 --> 00:53:29,331
And I kinda
want you back home too.

916
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:31,927
So, stand back.

917
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:33,939
I almost got it.

918
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:38,637
Hurry up, Wendell.
Fortune waits for no man.

919
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,614
Do you think he's ready
for the audition?

920
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:46,448
Well, why don't you see for yourself.

921
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:50,421
Come on, Odie.
Showtime.

922
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:53,816
Now.

923
00:53:53,893 --> 00:53:57,556
Ah. Good morning, New York.

924
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:01,396
I know you're gonna flip for Odie
because he sure is flipping for you.

925
00:54:01,468 --> 00:54:03,663

926
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:05,830
Ride 'em, cowboy.

927
00:54:05,905 --> 00:54:09,807
- A shock collar? That's... That's inhumane.
- Tomorrow's science today.

928
00:54:09,876 --> 00:54:13,505
Oh, gosh, hot doggy.

929
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,071
So, when does
our train leave?

930
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:18,913
Oh. Two hours.

931
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:21,647
Tickets?
Chop-chop.

932
00:54:24,524 --> 00:54:28,756
Poor Odie.
He faces a future of torture...

933
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:31,296
neglect and degradation.

934
00:54:31,364 --> 00:54:34,697
Hey, nobody gets to mistreat
my dog like that except me.

935
00:54:39,773 --> 00:54:43,869
Psst! I'll be right behind you,
little buddy.

936
00:54:43,943 --> 00:54:45,843

937
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:00,150
Surf's up!

938
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:03,855
Gravity, do your thang!

939
00:55:06,866 --> 00:55:11,132
Ah-ooh!

940
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:13,798
Ah-ooh!

941
00:55:13,873 --> 00:55:17,900
Woah!
Housekeeping at 12:00!

942
00:55:17,977 --> 00:55:20,207
Woah!
You know...

943
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,306
I think I had a nightmare
like this once.

944
00:55:23,383 --> 00:55:26,716
Woah!

945
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:43,566
Once again, my life has been saved
by the miracle of lasagna.

946
00:55:43,636 --> 00:55:47,868
I said limo, not taxi.
Do you know the difference?

947
00:55:47,941 --> 00:55:51,001
Odie, here I come!
Don't worry, fella.

948
00:55:51,077 --> 00:55:54,569
- I'll rescue you!
- Halt!

949
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:56,615
- Gotcha!
- Woah. Huh?

950
00:55:56,683 --> 00:55:59,015
Well, what have we got here?

951
00:55:59,085 --> 00:56:02,020
Looks like we got us
a cat with no tags.

952
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:04,386
Hey, McGillicuddy,
there's an animal felony...

953
00:56:04,457 --> 00:56:06,584
happening right there
behind you.

954
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:09,958
I'm trying to do
some rescue work here, pal.

955
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:11,963
- Hey!

956
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:14,727
- Welcome to my world, Red.
- I'm gonna call somebody about this.

957
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:17,031
- Newbie on the block.
- This is police brutality.

958
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:20,869
- Here we go.
- I have tags. I just left them in my other fur.

959
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,135
This is abusive now. This is abusive.

960
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:25,143
- In you go, big fella.
- Huh?

961
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:29,238
- What is with the cage?
- Okay, lock 'er down.

962
00:56:29,315 --> 00:56:32,842
Oh, now, this is insulting.
You know I'm house-trained.

963
00:56:32,919 --> 00:56:34,853
- Gimme newspaper?
- Settle down, people.

964
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:37,651
- I oughta give you a bunch of fives.
- Back about your business.

965
00:56:37,724 --> 00:56:40,818
- Rosa, I'm watching you.
- This is all a terrible mistake.

966
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:43,556
I was trying to save a friend...

967
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,962
that's not very smart,
needed my help.

968
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:48,500
I don't belong in here.
I have an owner.

969
00:56:48,568 --> 00:56:50,661
I-I'm not a stray.

970
00:56:51,738 --> 00:56:53,797
- Hi. I'm Jon Arbuckle.
- Hi.

971
00:56:53,873 --> 00:56:55,807
Um, I think you have
my dog Odie.

972
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:59,140
- I think you're mistaken.
- No, I saw the flier. Odie's my dog.

973
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:02,238
No, he's Happy Chapman's dog.

974
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:04,909
Happy Chapman?

975
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:09,080
The gentleman with the cat
on Channel 37.

976
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:11,680
He came
and took Odie home.

977
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:15,159
Odie's the family name,
you know?

978
00:57:16,496 --> 00:57:18,657
- Well, uh, good day.
- Wait. Wait.

979
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:24,230
Happy Chapman took Odie?
You think he's got Garfield too?

980
00:57:24,304 --> 00:57:27,535
I-I don't know.
But we're gonna find out.

981
00:57:27,607 --> 00:57:28,074

982
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:29,905

983
00:57:32,445 --> 00:57:34,379
Ah, shut up!

984
00:57:34,447 --> 00:57:36,415
Hey, save it
for talent night.

985
00:57:40,486 --> 00:57:42,681

986
00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:45,952
Could you please be quiet?
Guard! Guards!

987
00:57:46,025 --> 00:57:48,016
Oh, this really
is too much.

988
00:57:48,094 --> 00:57:52,793
Hey, Persnikitty. Happy Chapman's cat.
What are you doing in here?

989
00:57:52,865 --> 00:57:57,734
I was his cat
until I outlived my purpose.

990
00:57:57,804 --> 00:58:01,831
Oh, then he replaced me with a dog
and dumped me in this wretched place.

991
00:58:01,908 --> 00:58:05,309
- All humans are the same.
- Oh, not Jon, my owner.

992
00:58:05,378 --> 00:58:08,905
No way.
He only does what's best for me.

993
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:11,473
He puts up with me,
and he feeds me.

994
00:58:11,551 --> 00:58:14,486
And he lets you vacation
in this charming animal pound. Hello?

995
00:58:14,554 --> 00:58:16,419
Yeah, not for long,
Persnikitty.

996
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:18,616
Would you please
just stop calling me that?

997
00:58:18,691 --> 00:58:21,319
My name isn't
really Persnikitty.

998
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:23,919
- It's Sir Roland.
- Sir Roland?

999
00:58:23,997 --> 00:58:26,898
Yes. Another one of
Happy Chapman's acts of cruelty.

1000
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:29,662
I was trained in the classical theater,
you know. Uh-huh.

1001
00:58:29,736 --> 00:58:33,433
But now, I'm a celebrity
cable castoff cat...

1002
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:35,997
with a name
I can never live down.

1003
00:58:36,075 --> 00:58:38,009
Well, this may hurt
a little then.

1004
00:58:38,077 --> 00:58:41,240
I'm trying to rescue the dog
that replaced you, Persnikitty.

1005
00:58:41,314 --> 00:58:45,910
I mean, Roland. Uh, Happy and Odie
are getting on a train in less than two hours...

1006
00:58:45,985 --> 00:58:48,453
to go to New York to become regulars
on Good Day, New York.

1007
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:51,718
Wait a minute.
Did I just hear that right?

1008
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:55,249
You're a cat that's
trying to rescue a dog?

1009
00:58:55,328 --> 00:58:58,388
It's true. I know.
It's a crime against nature.

1010
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:01,922
At first I thought he was a pain,
but he's grown on me...

1011
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:05,266
like a wart you wanna have removed
until you realize...

1012
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:08,136
it defines you
in some funny way.

1013
00:59:08,207 --> 00:59:11,108
Do you know, that is
absolutely charming.

1014
00:59:11,177 --> 00:59:14,044
Let me ask you
a question, chubby.

1015
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:16,047
What are you talking about?

1016
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:20,211
How could you understand?
He's my friend.

1017
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:23,153
Oh, my gosh.
How low have I sunk?

1018
00:59:23,222 --> 00:59:25,816
Guard, may I have
some shoelaces, please?

1019
00:59:27,226 --> 00:59:30,821
Well, hello there.
Right on time.

1020
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,229
All right. I need a five-count lineup
right now. Let's go.

1021
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:35,267
- Move, move, move.
- Hey, what's going on?

1022
00:59:35,335 --> 00:59:38,304
Adoption. Looks like one of us
is getting out of here.

1023
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:40,931
So, you're here
to look at a cat.

1024
00:59:41,007 --> 00:59:42,975
All right. Well, let's see
if we can't take care of you.

1025
00:59:43,042 --> 00:59:45,510
- Careful.
- Let's go, boys. Let's hurry it up.

1026
00:59:45,578 --> 00:59:47,773
Can I just say
your hands are freezing?

1027
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:52,045
How are you, newbie?
This might be your lucky day.

1028
00:59:52,118 --> 00:59:54,052
Come here.
There you go.

1029
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,611
Oh, you are a heavy one.

1030
00:59:56,689 --> 00:59:59,590
- Excuse me. Muscle weighs more than fat.
- Come on. That's right.

1031
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:02,219
- Come over here.
- Check this.

1032
01:00:02,295 --> 01:00:04,923
Hey, what about me?

1033
01:00:04,997 --> 01:00:07,761
All right.
Let's line it up.

1034
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:10,132
Paws on the white line.
Tails in the air.

1035
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:14,074
I don't need to be adopted, guys.
My guy Jon is coming to get me, I'm sure.

1036
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,675
- That one.
- Really.

1037
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:18,711
She picked me!
She picked me! She did!

1038
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:22,009
- She picked me. She picked me.
- Not that one.

1039
01:00:22,082 --> 01:00:25,051
That one. The one that looks
like the cat on TV.

1040
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:27,177
Back it up, Red.
She went with Trigger.

1041
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:29,221
- Sorry, love.
- Come here.

1042
01:00:29,289 --> 01:00:31,519
Better luck next time.
Now you be careful.

1043
01:00:31,591 --> 01:00:34,458
- There you go.
- That's not... That's sore. Ow!

1044
01:00:34,527 --> 01:00:36,995
Jon's gonna be here
in five minutes anyway.

1045
01:00:37,664 --> 01:00:39,825
When I give the signal,
run like a mad cow.

1046
01:00:39,899 --> 01:00:42,129
- What?
- Don't you want to save your friend?

1047
01:00:42,202 --> 01:00:44,568
- Do I really have to run?
- Now!

1048
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:47,231
Eat hair ball, Happy Chapman!

1049
01:00:47,307 --> 01:00:49,332
- Not the red button!

1050
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:54,244
Once more
into the breach, dear friends. Once more!

1051
01:00:54,314 --> 01:00:57,215

1052
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:59,547

1053
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:01,644
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- I'm going. I'm going.

1054
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:04,246
Run! Run! Let's go!
Get the door!

1055
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:08,393
Hey, there's a fire hydrant!

1056
01:01:08,461 --> 01:01:10,929
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

1057
01:01:18,138 --> 01:01:20,572
Code blue! Code blue!
We got runners. We got runners.

1058
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,736
Halt! Stop! You have not
been cleared for release.

1059
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:27,609

1060
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,374
- Garfield's been here.
- Uh, excuse me.

1061
01:01:56,442 --> 01:01:59,809
- Can I help you with something?
- We're looking for Happy Chapman.

1062
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:02,609
Uh, yeah. He's on his way to the train station.
He's going to New York.

1063
01:02:02,682 --> 01:02:04,582
D-Do you guys
have a pass or something?

1064
01:02:04,651 --> 01:02:06,744
- I'm gonna have to ask you guys to leave.
- Thank you.

1065
01:02:06,819 --> 01:02:08,753
Okay, thanks.

1066
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,293
- Oh, excuse me.

1067
01:02:15,361 --> 01:02:19,092
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...

1068
01:02:19,165 --> 01:02:23,659
is now departing
from Platform 12.

1069
01:02:23,736 --> 01:02:26,830
All aboard!

1070
01:02:26,906 --> 01:02:29,636
All aboard!

1071
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:39,951
Good afternoon, gentlemen. What will you be
having today... salmon, steak or lasagna?

1072
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:43,113
Steak.
I hate lasagna.

1073
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:47,751
Beep, beep. Cat coming through.
Beep, beep. Going through the tunnel.

1074
01:02:47,827 --> 01:02:49,954
- Nyow! I just had to do that.
- It's a cat!

1075
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:53,465
Final call
for the New Amsterdam Limited.

1076
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:59,438
The New Amsterdam Limited
is now departing from Platform 12.

1077
01:02:59,505 --> 01:03:02,338
No. Wait.
Please. Stop.

1078
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:05,673
Wait. Don't. No. Oh.

1079
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:07,975
You monster, Chapman!

1080
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:12,313
I can't outrun a train.

1081
01:03:12,385 --> 01:03:14,319
Whoa.
Watch the train, pal.

1082
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:16,981
- Let's wait here now, honey.
- Hey.

1083
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:21,618
I got it. It's just a train set, only bigger.

1084
01:03:23,596 --> 01:03:25,530
- Oh, no, we're too late.
- No.

1085
01:03:25,598 --> 01:03:29,694
We're gonna stop
that train. Come on.

1086
01:03:29,769 --> 01:03:31,999
Somewhere around here...

1087
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:34,266
there's gotta be
a big table...

1088
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,638
with all the trains on it.

1089
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:39,769
Yeah, now's a good time
to take a 10-minute break, Ted.

1090
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:41,780
Over and out.

1091
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:46,016
He looks like the type.

1092
01:03:46,085 --> 01:03:49,953
And this must be where
he's got his little table.

1093
01:03:52,158 --> 01:03:55,059
I'm very sorry, sir.
There's simply no way to stop that train.

1094
01:03:55,128 --> 01:03:58,097
Ma'am, you don't understand.
You have to stop that train.

1095
01:03:58,164 --> 01:04:01,099
My dog and my cat
are on that train.

1096
01:04:01,167 --> 01:04:04,261
I suppose if Jon
can do this, I can.

1097
01:04:08,975 --> 01:04:11,739
Okay, we gotta find our train.
Let's see what happens when I do this.

1098
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:13,745
- 

1099
01:04:15,648 --> 01:04:19,049
Boston Express switching to Track 18.

1100
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:22,178
Well, I'm sorry. Folks in Boston
are gonna be a little late today.

1101
01:04:22,255 --> 01:04:24,519
- Ha!

1102
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:28,456
Let's see what happens
when I do this.

1103
01:04:28,528 --> 01:04:31,861
- Warning: Seattle Wind...
- No, I don't care about Seattle.

1104
01:04:33,266 --> 01:04:35,029
Warning: Collision.

1105
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,729
Ma'am, I'm looking for
one train in particular.

1106
01:04:37,804 --> 01:04:41,262
Just one second.
I'm trying to find my friend.

1107
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:45,209
- The New Amsterdam Limited...
- There's the Amsterdam.

1108
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:49,715
- Warning: Collision, 20 seconds.

1109
01:04:49,782 --> 01:04:52,774
- Gosh, you sound like my mother.

1110
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:55,412
- All right, hold up. Everybody stop.

1111
01:04:55,488 --> 01:04:59,788
- Warning.

1112
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:02,919
- Five, four...
- Stop what you're doing!

1113
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:05,555
- Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
- All stop.

1114
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:09,727

1115
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:12,362
- Yeah!

1116
01:05:12,438 --> 01:05:15,066
Okay, everybody.
Let's take it from the top.

1117
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:17,473
- Okay?

1118
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:21,647
- You have to stop that train.
- Hold on.

1119
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:23,739

1120
01:05:23,816 --> 01:05:26,842
I'll be down to meet you
at the station, Odie.

1121
01:05:26,919 --> 01:05:31,447
Actually, that train has stopped.
It's returning to the station.

1122
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:35,350
Are we on the right train?

1123
01:05:38,765 --> 01:05:40,289

1124
01:05:44,003 --> 01:05:47,996
- Where are ya?

1125
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:50,508
I think I recognize
that whine.

1126
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:55,536

1127
01:05:55,615 --> 01:05:57,549
Hey, come on.

1128
01:05:57,617 --> 01:06:00,609
- See, these are the kinds of seats you get...

1129
01:06:00,686 --> 01:06:03,484
when you book
at the last minute.

1130
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:07,720
Good to see you, partner.

1131
01:06:11,764 --> 01:06:13,698
Let's get outta here.

1132
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:15,935
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...

1133
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,664
Your attention please.
The New Amsterdam Limited...

1134
01:06:17,737 --> 01:06:20,672
is making an unscheduled stop
on Platform 12.

1135
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,731
No, sir,
please take your seat.

1136
01:06:22,809 --> 01:06:25,972
- No, no, my future is running away from me.
- What's the trouble here?

1137
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:28,309

1138
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:32,841
Please, stay calm
and go back to your seat.

1139
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:34,853
- Hey!
- How rude!

1140
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:36,411
Buddy!

1141
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,694

1142
01:06:47,433 --> 01:06:49,367
Ah.

1143
01:06:54,774 --> 01:06:58,608
Hey, could you slow down?
I've been doing this running thing all day.

1144
01:06:58,678 --> 01:07:02,011
And I am over it.
Hey, we-re... we're safe now.

1145
01:07:02,081 --> 01:07:04,276
We're free. Oh.

1146
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,615
- If it isn't Unhappy Chappy.
- Going somewhere?

1147
01:07:10,089 --> 01:07:13,024
Nice accessory, but I don't think
I want to play "dress up" with you, pal.

1148
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:15,424
Let's get outta here.
Let's beat it!

1149
01:07:19,966 --> 01:07:22,196
Oh, right in the nose again!

1150
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:25,999
- So, it's gonna get physical, is it?

1151
01:07:26,072 --> 01:07:29,974
Did you really think you could just
run away from Happy Chapman?

1152
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:31,976
Oh, is this a cry for help.

1153
01:07:32,044 --> 01:07:35,138
No dumb dirty animal is ever
gonna get the better of me.

1154
01:07:35,214 --> 01:07:38,547
And let's see how you feel
with 200 volts coursing...

1155
01:07:38,618 --> 01:07:41,246
- through that thick canine skull of yours.
- Chapman...

1156
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,950
- Come here.
- Get your hands off of my friend!

1157
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:48,118

1158
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,563

1159
01:07:53,633 --> 01:07:56,659
- Hey, Boomer. What round is it?
- Good to see you, chubby.

1160
01:07:56,736 --> 01:07:59,136
- We're here to help.
- Sir Roland?

1161
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:01,332
In the fur!

1162
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:05,070
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

1163
01:08:05,144 --> 01:08:07,612

1164
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:12,514

1165
01:08:12,585 --> 01:08:14,576

1166
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:21,758

1167
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:24,853

1168
01:08:24,931 --> 01:08:27,422
- Okay. Okay.

1169
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,199
Rats! Aah!

1170
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:39,077
All right, here's the drill. Cats,
scratch like you've never scratched before.

1171
01:08:39,145 --> 01:08:41,340
Dogs, bite but don't chew.
And, rats...

1172
01:08:41,414 --> 01:08:44,713
- See if you can get that
pretty necklace around his neck.

1173
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:51,883
Canines, felines and "vermines':

1174
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:55,121
It's showtime.

1175
01:08:55,194 --> 01:08:57,992
All right, boys.
Dog pile!

1176
01:08:58,064 --> 01:09:00,464

1177
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:03,866
Thanks, boys.
The home team will take it from here.

1178
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:06,131
Better split before
animal control gets here.

1179
01:09:06,205 --> 01:09:09,641
- Hey, Garfield, shake it easy.
- See you later, Garfield.
- Yeah, good luck.

1180
01:09:11,811 --> 01:09:14,075
Odie, would you mind
sharing the remote, please?

1181
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,514
Every dog
has his day, Happy.

1182
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:24,852
- Nice kitty.
- Let's see what's on the news.

1183
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:26,983

1184
01:09:29,128 --> 01:09:31,392
Let me tell you
something, Happy.

1185
01:09:31,464 --> 01:09:35,525
To you, Odie might be
just a dumb, stupid, smelly dog.

1186
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:37,899
- But to me, he's all that and much more.

1187
01:09:39,672 --> 01:09:42,436
He's my friend.

1188
01:09:42,508 --> 01:09:45,705
Odie, try something else.
Maybe there's a game on.

1189
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:49,243

1190
01:09:52,752 --> 01:09:54,686
Strong finish,
little buddy.

1191
01:09:55,688 --> 01:09:57,747
Odie? Garfield?

1192
01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:00,519
- Odie?
- Odie? Odie?

1193
01:10:03,062 --> 01:10:06,862
- Be happy.
- This is for stealing my dog and my cat.

1194
01:10:10,136 --> 01:10:12,070
He didn't steal me.
I was doing the rescue work.

1195
01:10:12,138 --> 01:10:14,470
Garfield! Odie!

1196
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,906
- Come here. Hi.
- Oh, come here.

1197
01:10:16,976 --> 01:10:20,412
Oh, I missed you guys so much.
I was so worried about you.

1198
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:22,413
I'm never gonna let you
out of my sight again.

1199
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:26,349
Never. You guys
are my best friends.

1200
01:10:26,419 --> 01:10:30,480
- You had me at hello.
- Oh.

1201
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:33,457
- Get outta here.
- This is Walter J. Chapman...

1202
01:10:33,526 --> 01:10:35,460
with breaking news
from the Midwest.

1203
01:10:35,528 --> 01:10:38,224
Abby Shields reporting.
Whatcha got for me, Abby?

1204
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:42,461
Details are sketchy,
but it appears that a deranged man...

1205
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:44,469
may be the cause
of all the trouble here.

1206
01:10:44,537 --> 01:10:46,596
A deranged man?
What is this?

1207
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:50,108
In fact, the police are bringing
the suspect out as we speak.

1208
01:10:50,176 --> 01:10:52,576
Aah! Good grief.
It's my idiot brother.

1209
01:10:52,645 --> 01:10:55,614
Hey, that's Happy Chapman.

1210
01:10:55,681 --> 01:10:58,548
He's going for a ride
in the police car.

1211
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:01,108
But sources tell me
that this incident...

1212
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:05,317
somehow involved a dog
and a very heroic cat.

1213
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:09,020
- Garfield!
- Hey, he saved Odie!

1214
01:11:09,095 --> 01:11:12,064
- Now he's a hero.
- Oh, I didn't realize.

1215
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:14,429
Garfield's on TV.
He's a hero.

1216
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:19,494
Garfield! That's Garfield.

1217
01:11:19,572 --> 01:11:21,870
- Garfield's a hero now!
- Thanks, everybody.

1218
01:11:21,941 --> 01:11:24,171
- Hero!
- Well, thanks for saying so. It's nice to hear.

1219
01:11:24,243 --> 01:11:27,508
- We're a whole street full of heroes.
- It sounds sincere. Thank you.

1220
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,912
- Yeah. Heroes!
- Okay.

1221
01:11:29,982 --> 01:11:31,916
I've been waiting years for this.

1222
01:11:31,984 --> 01:11:34,009
- Whoa!
- Come on, pal.

1223
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:38,113
- Hey, Arlene.
- Wow. It's nice to be recognized by your peers.

1224
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:42,388
I couldn't have done this
without you. I...

1225
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:44,520
We...

1226
01:11:44,597 --> 01:11:47,293
You're a really
great friend.

1227
01:11:47,366 --> 01:11:51,132
Jon, I wanna be more
than your friend.

1228
01:11:52,404 --> 01:11:54,964
- You do?
- Yeah.

1229
01:11:58,177 --> 01:12:00,338
Where do they find the energy?

1230
01:12:14,691 --> 01:12:16,955

1231
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:24,595
Yeah, just
one big happy family.

1232
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:28,194
Yeah, right!
Hit the floor.

1233
01:12:28,271 --> 01:12:30,603
No, seriously,
you can come up, buddy.

1234
01:12:30,673 --> 01:12:33,335
Come on. Come on.
No, seriously. Come on up.

1235
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:37,975
Down you go. We just
hit it off so great...

1236
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:40,811
because we both love
the same thing, and that is...

1237
01:12:40,883 --> 01:12:43,078
- Me.

1238
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:46,144

1239
01:13:12,048 --> 01:13:14,039

1240
01:13:14,117 --> 01:13:16,051

1241
01:13:18,588 --> 01:13:20,886
Uh, oops.

1242
01:13:21,024 --> 01:13:26,257
Hey, Odie, help me.
I can't get up.

1243
01:13:27,363 --> 01:13:31,800
Odie, my friend,
bring me some ice.

1244
01:13:31,868 --> 01:13:35,565
Will you hurry up, you dumb dog?
I'm in pain.
